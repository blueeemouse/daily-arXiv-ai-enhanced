The process of creating a trailer typically involves selecting key scenes, dialogues and action sequences from the main content and editing them together in a way that effectively conveys the tone, theme and overall appeal of the movie. This often includes adding music, sound effects, visual effects and text overlays to enhance the impact of the trailer. In this paper, we present a framework exploiting a comprehensive multimodal strategy for automated trailer production. Also, a Large Language Model (LLM) is adopted across various stages of the trailer creation. First, it selects main key visual sequences that are relevant to the movie's core narrative. Then, it extracts the most appealing quotes from the movie, aligning them with the trailer's narrative. Additionally, the LLM assists in creating music backgrounds and voiceovers to enrich the audience's engagement, thus contributing to make a trailer not just a summary of the movie's content but a narrative experience in itself. Results show that our framework generates trailers that are more visually appealing to viewers compared to those produced by previous state-of-the-art competitors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u5168\u9762\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9884\u544a\u7247\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u544a\u7247\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9884\u544a\u7247\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5438\u5f15\u89c2\u4f17\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5f71\u9884\u544a\u7247\u7684\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u7efc\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u4ea7\u9884\u544a\u7247\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u603b\u7ed3\u7535\u5f71\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u521b\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u53d9\u4e8b\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u53d6\u4e0e\u7535\u5f71\u6838\u5fc3\u53d9\u4e8b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4e3b\u89c6\u89c9\u5e8f\u5217\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u51fa\u6700\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u7535\u5f71\u53f0\u8bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u9884\u544a\u7247\u7684\u6545\u4e8b\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u80cc\u666f\u97f3\u4e50\u548c\u65c1\u767d\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u89c2\u4f17\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u65b0\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u4e3a\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u9884\u544a\u7247\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9884\u544a\u7247\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u544a\u7247\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

While recent foundation models enable rich semantic representations across vision, audio, and language, retrieving relevant observations from massive archives remains challenging due to the computational cost of high-dimensional similarity search. In this work, we introduce compact hypercube embeddings for fast text-based wildlife observation retrieval, a framework that enables efficient text-based search over large-scale wildlife image and audio databases using compact binary representations. Building on the cross-view code alignment hashing framework, we extend lightweight hashing beyond a single-modality setup to align natural language descriptions with visual or acoustic observations in a shared Hamming space. Our approach leverages pretrained wildlife foundation models, including BioCLIP and BioLingual, and adapts them efficiently for hashing using parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We evaluate our method on large-scale benchmarks, including iNaturalist2024 for text-to-image retrieval and iNatSounds2024 for text-to-audio retrieval, as well as multiple soundscape datasets to assess robustness under domain shift. Results show that retrieval using discrete hypercube embeddings achieves competitive, and in several cases superior, performance compared to continuous embeddings, while drastically reducing memory and search cost. Moreover, we observe that the hashing objective consistently improves the underlying encoder representations, leading to stronger retrieval and zero-shot generalization. These results demonstrate that binary, language-based retrieval enables scalable and efficient search over large wildlife archives for biodiversity monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u5bdf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u8868\u793a\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u97f3\u9891\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4f9d\u8d56\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u8d8a\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u58f0\u97f3\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u4ece\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6863\u6848\u5e93\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7d27\u51d1\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u89c2\u5bdf\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee3\u7801\u5bf9\u9f50\u54c8\u5e0c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u54c8\u5e0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e4b\u5916\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u6c49\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5bf9\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u58f0\u5b66\u89c2\u5bdf\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u690d\u7269\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982BioCLIP\u548cBioLingual\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u54c8\u5e0c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5305\u62eciNaturalist2024\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u548ciNatSounds2024\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5230\u97f3\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u58f0\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u8d85\u7acb\u65b9\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8fde\u7eed\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u54c8\u5e0c\u76ee\u6807\u59cb\u7ec8\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5e95\u5c42\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u52a0\u5f3a\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u68c0\u7d22\u4f7f\u5f97\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u91ce\u751f\u52a8\u7269\u6863\u6848\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e00\u5927\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals. Action Learning belongs to the French policy that aims to improve the volume and the quality of the contracts between Universities and companies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5b89\u70ed\u5927\u5b66\u7ee7\u7eed\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u9662\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\u8ba9\u5927\u5b66\u5458\u5de5\u53ca\u516c\u79c1\u4f01\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u63a5\u89e6\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6cd5\u56fd\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u804c\u4e1a\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u7b26\u5408\u6cd5\u56fd\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u5b66\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u95f4\u5408\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u6ca1\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5904\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u4f46\u4e86\u89e3\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u5458\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b89\u70ed\u5927\u5b66\u7ee7\u7eed\u6559\u80b2\u5b66\u9662\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f20\u6388\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f20\u9012\u4e86\u987e\u95ee\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u6559\u5e08\u5728\u9879\u76ee\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u62c5\u4efb\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u3002\u5b83\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6cd5\u56fd\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b20\u591a\u5e74\u6765\u7684\u8de8\u5b66\u671f\u9879\u76ee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5b66\u751f\u5c06\u65b0\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b89\u70ed\u5927\u5b66\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5904\u7406\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f46\u719f\u6089\u81ea\u8eab\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57f9\u8bad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6559\u5b66\u548c\u804c\u4e1a\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\u96c6\u5408\u4e86\u6cd5\u56fd\u6280\u672f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u6210\u529f\u8981\u7d20\u3001\u5bf9\u804c\u4e1a\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u670d\u52a1\u5546\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u6210\u6559\u5b66\u4e0e\u804c\u4e1a\u4e0a\u53ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6301\u4e45\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u7740\u6cd5\u56fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5927\u5b66\u4e0e\u4f01\u4e1a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet dominant systems fuse modalities in the spatial domain, obscuring the frequency structure of signals and amplifying misalignment and redundancy. We adopt a spectral information-theoretic view and show that, under an orthogonal transform that approximately block-diagonalizes bandwise covariances, the Gaussian Information Bottleneck objective decouples across frequency bands, providing a principled basis for separate-then-fuse paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose FITMM, a Frequency-aware Information-Theoretic framework for multimodal recommendation. FITMM constructs graph-enhanced item representations, performs modality-wise spectral decomposition to obtain orthogonal bands, and forms lightweight within-band multimodal components. A residual, task-adaptive gate aggregates bands into the final representation. To control redundancy and improve generalization, we regularize training with a frequency-domain IB term that allocates capacity across bands (Wiener-like shrinkage with shut-off of weak bands). We further introduce a cross-modal spectral consistency loss that aligns modalities within each band. The model is jointly optimized with the standard recommendation loss. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that FITMM consistently and significantly outperforms advanced baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u6846\u67b6FITMM\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9891\u5e26\u5185\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u805a\u5408\u5404\u9891\u5e26\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFITMM\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u4ece\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FITMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u9879\u76ee\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u7ea7\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u4ea4\u9891\u5e26\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5355\u9891\u5e26\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u6765\u6c47\u603b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9891\u5e26\u81f3\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9891\u7387\u57dfIB\u9879\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9891\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u540c\u4e00\u9891\u5e26\u5185\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u8350\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cFITMM\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9ad8\u7ea7\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7FITMM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5197\u4f59\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSRIU\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5de6\u53f3\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53f3\u5de6\u6269\u5c55\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7528\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff08IPEUP\uff09\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4f4d\u56fe\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6548\u7528\u8868\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SRIU\u80fd\u591f\u6539\u5584\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u957f\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\uff08HUSRs\uff09\u4e0e\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65b0\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5148\u524d\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6316\u6398\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684HUSRs\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5SRIU\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5de6\u53f3\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53f3\u5de6\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u6709\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684HUSRs\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSRIU\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7528\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff08IPEUP\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u7ec4\u4e0a\u9650\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3aSRIU\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Bitmap\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6548\u7528\u8868\u8f85\u52a9\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6765\u81ea\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7b49\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SRIU\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SRIU\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6316\u6398\u5177\u6709\u9012\u589e\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6316\u6398\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

With large language models (LLMs) on the cloud, semantic user representations can improve sequential recommendation by capturing high-level intent. However, regenerating such representations via cloud LLM inference for every request is often infeasible at real-world scale. As a result, on-device reranking commonly reuses a cached cloud semantic user embedding across requests. We empirically identify a cloud semantic staleness effect: reused embeddings become less aligned with the user's latest interactions, leading to measurable ranking degradation.\n  Most existing LLM-enabled cloud-device recommenders are typically designed around on-demand cloud semantics, either by assuming low-latency cloud LLM access or by regenerating semantic embeddings per request. When per-request regeneration is infeasible and cached semantics must be reused, two technical challenges arise: (1) deciding when cached cloud semantics remain useful for on-device reranking, and (2) maintaining ranking quality when the cloud LLM cannot be invoked and only cached semantics are available. To address this gap, we introduce the Semantic Calibration for LLM-enabled Cloud-Device Recommendation (SCaLRec).

The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items. Finally, the proposed RSC method was evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RSC\uff09\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u6548\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u6548\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u591a\u6761\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u6548\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08RSC\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u9884\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u652f\u6301\u5ea6\u6765\u9884\u4f30\u5206\u5272\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u70b9\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u524d\u4ef6\u548c\u540e\u4ef6\u7684\u6240\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cRSC\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7528\u94fe\u63a5\u8868\u52a0\u901f\u5019\u9009\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4e0a\u754c\u2014\u2014\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u7f29\u51cf\u5269\u4f59\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u590d\u9879\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In practice, however, pipeline jobs often fail intermittently due to non-deterministic tests, network outages, infrastructure failures, resource exhaustion, and other reliability issues. These intermittent (flaky) job failures lead to substantial inefficiencies: wasted computational resources from repeated reruns and significant diagnosis time that distracts developers from core activities and often requires intervention from specialized teams. Prior work has proposed machine learning techniques to detect intermittent failures, but does not address the subsequent diagnosis challenge. To fill this gap, we introduce FlaXifyer, a few-shot learning approach for predicting intermittent job failure categories using pre-trained language models.

While recent semantic-based parsers leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit superior generalizability over traditional syntax-based methods, their effectiveness is heavily contingent on model scale. This dependency leads to significant performance collapse when employing smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. Such degradation creates a major barrier to real-world adoption, where data privacy requirements and computational constraints necessitate the use of succinct models. To bridge this gap, we propose EFParser, an unsupervised LLM-based log parser designed to enhance the capabilities of smaller models through systematic architectural innovation. EFParser introduces a dual-cache system with an adaptive updating mechanism that distinguishes between novel patterns and variations of existing templates. This allows the parser to merge redundant templates and rectify prior errors, maintaining cache consistency. Furthermore, a dedicated correction module acts as a gatekeeper, validating and refining every LLM-generated template before caching to prevent error injection. Empirical evaluations on public large-scale datasets demonstrate that EFParser outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 12.5% across all metrics when running on smaller LLMs, even surpassing some baselines utilizing large-scale models.

By prioritising availability over consistency under partition, nodes accumulate events in different orders, and rely on an associative, commutative and idempotent merge function to present a materialised view of the CRDT. Under some circumstances, the state of the materialised view over time can appear to ''roll back'' previously applied events. When the materialised view is used to manage group permissions such as ones found in instant messaging applications, this can lead to surprising behaviour. This can occur when there are multiple concurrent events, such as in the Duelling Admins problem where two equally permissioned admins concurrently revoke each other's permissions. Who wins? This article argues that a Byzantine admin can exploit concurrency to win the duel. As a result, an external arbiter is required to arbitrate an immutable happens-before relation between concurrent events. Arbitration occurs asynchronously in batches via optional ''epoch events'', preserving availability. This introduces a bounded total order within epochs, and the resulting ''finality'' improves on the level of consistency CRDTs can provide.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86CRDTs\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ba1\u7406\u5373\u65f6\u901a\u8baf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6743\u9650\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u6eda\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u4ef2\u88c1\u8005\u548c'epoch\u4e8b\u4ef6'\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8CRDT\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3CRDTs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5982\u5373\u65f6\u6d88\u606f\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6743\u9650\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u66f4\u65b0\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u62e5\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6743\u9650\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u5458\u540c\u65f6\u64a4\u9500\u5bf9\u65b9\u6743\u9650\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5916\u90e8\u4ef2\u88c1\u8005\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5e76\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d8\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9009\u7684'epoch\u4e8b\u4ef6'\u6279\u91cf\u5f02\u6b65\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef2\u88c1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u754c\u5168\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u4ef2\u88c1\u53ca'epoch\u4e8b\u4ef6'\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u72b6\u6001\u770b\u4f3c\u56de\u9000\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347CRDT\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u7ba1\u7406\u7fa4\u7ec4\u6743\u9650\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e8e\u5e76\u53d1\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684CRDT\u72b6\u6001\u56de\u6eda\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u501f\u52a9\u5916\u90e8\u4ef2\u88c1\u673a\u5236\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8b\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\u3002"}}

These methods typically employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt LLMs to recommendation scenarios, and utilize beam search during inference to efficiently retrieve $B$ top-ranked recommended items. However, we identify a critical training-inference inconsistency: while SFT optimizes the overall probability of positive items, it does not guarantee that such items will be retrieved by beam search even if they possess high overall probabilities. Due to the greedy pruning mechanism, beam search can prematurely discard a positive item once its prefix probability is insufficient.\n  To address this inconsistency, we propose BEAR (Beam-SEarch-Aware Regularization), a novel fine-tuning objective that explicitly accounts for beam search behavior during training. Rather than directly simulating beam search for each instance during training, which is computationally prohibitive, BEAR enforces a relaxed necessary condition: each token in a positive item must rank within the top-$B$ candidate tokens at each decoding step.

Among these tasks, software migration, a critical process of adapting code to evolving environments, has been largely overlooked. In this study, we introduce TimeMachine-bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate software migration in real-world Python projects. Our benchmark consists of GitHub repositories whose tests begin to fail in response to dependency updates. The construction process is fully automated, enabling live updates of the benchmark. Furthermore, we curated a human-verified subset to ensure problem solvability. We evaluated agent-based baselines built on top of 11 models, including both strong open-weight and state-of-the-art LLMs on this verified subset. Our results indicated that, while LLMs show some promise for migration tasks, they continue to face substantial reliability challenges, including spurious solutions that exploit low test coverage and unnecessary edits stemming from suboptimal tool-use strategies.

In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance.

Current retrieval systems either ignore these constraints in neural embeddings or approximate them in a generative reasoning process that can be inconsistent and unreliable. Although well-suited to structured reasoning, existing neuro-symbolic approaches remain confined to formal logic or mathematics problems as they often assume unambiguous queries and access to complete evidence, conditions rarely met in information retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework that decouples predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning: a large language model (LLM) provides plausibility scores for atomic predicates in one decoding-free forward pass, from which a probabilistic reasoning engine derives the posterior probability of query satisfaction. We evaluate OrLog across multiple backbone LLMs, varying levels of access to external knowledge, and a range of logical constraints, and compare it against base retrievers and LLM-as-reasoner methods. Provided with entity descriptions, OrLog can significantly boost top-rank precision compared to LLM reasoning with larger gains on disjunctive queries. OrLog is also more efficient, cutting mean tokens by $\\sim$90\\% per query-entity pair. These results demonstrate that generation-free predicate plausibility estimation combined with probabilistic reasoning enables constraint-aware retrieval that outperforms monolithic reasoning while using far fewer tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "OrLog, a neuro-symbolic retrieval framework, separates predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning, using LLMs to provide plausibility scores and a probabilistic engine for query satisfaction.

The motivation is to create a system that can effectively handle these logical constraints while also being applicable to the broader, less structured domain of information retrieval, where queries are often ambiguous and evidence incomplete.", "method": "The method involves the introduction of OrLog, a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to estimate the plausibility of atomic predicates without requiring a decoding process, followed by a probabilistic reasoning engine to calculate the posterior probability of satisfying the query. This approach allows for constraint-aware retrieval without the need for generating text, thus reducing the number of tokens used.", "result": "OrLog significantly enhances top-rank precision, particularly for disjunctive queries, compared to methods that use LLMs directly for reasoning. Additionally, it achieves this with a substantial reduction in token usage, approximately 90% less per query-entity pair, indicating a more efficient solution.", "conclusion": "By decoupling predicate-level plausibility estimation from logical reasoning and employing a combination of LLMs and a probabilistic reasoning engine, OrLog demonstrates superior performance in constraint-aware retrieval. This approach not only outperforms traditional LLM-as-reasoner methods but does so with greatly improved efficiency."}}

Log parsing, which extracts structured events from massive unstructured log data, is a critical first step for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and failure diagnosis. With advances in large language models (LLMs), leveraging their strong text understanding capabilities has proven effective for accurate log parsing. However, existing LLM-based log parsers all focus on the constant part of logs, ignoring the potential contribution of the variable part to log parsing. This constant-centric strategy brings four key problems. First, inefficient log grouping and sampling with only constant information. Second, a relatively large number of LLM invocations due to constant-based cache, leading to low log parsing accuracy and efficiency. Third, a relatively large number of consumed constant tokens in prompts leads to high LLM invocation costs. At last, these methods only retain placeholders in the results, losing the system visibility brought by variable information in logs.\n  Facing these problems, we propose a variable-centric log parsing strategy named VarParser. Through variable contribution sampling, variable-centric parsing cache, and adaptive variable-aware in-context learning, our approach can efficiently capture the variable parts of logs and leverage their contributions to parsing. By introducing variable units, we preserve rich variable information, enhancing the integrity of log parsing results. Extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that VarParser achieves higher accuracy compared to existing methods, significantly improving parsing efficiency while reducing the LLM invocation costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VarParser\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u6790\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65e5\u5fd7\u7684\u5e38\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u5206\u7ec4\u548c\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u3001\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u6210\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e22\u5931\u7531\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVarParser\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u8d21\u732e\u62bd\u6837\u3001\u4ee5\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u65e5\u5fd7\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u4fdd\u7559\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cVarParser\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u6790\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0cVarParser\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u65e5\u5fd7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e5\u5fd7\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002"}}

This paradigm extends into deep learning through model reuse. Recently, model merging has emerged in the domain of large language models (LLMs) as a training-free approach that takes multiple task-specific models with the same architecture as source models and merges them without retraining, enhancing model reuse within LLMs. However, no prior work has systematically investigated whether such an approach can be effectively applied to other deep learning models with different architectures across domains. To bridge this gap, we present the first systematic study that evaluates five model merging techniques on three distinct model architectures across three domains: LLMs, image classification, and autonomous driving. Our findings reveal that directly applying existing model merging techniques leads to highly inconsistent results and falls notably short of their success within LLMs. Moreover, a single model merging technique often fails to handle the heterogeneous structural properties within a model, limiting its applicability to different model architectures across domains. Furthermore, the effectiveness of model merging techniques is highly sensitive to hyperparameter configurations, thereby constraining their potential for broader adoption. Inspired by these insights, we propose AutoMerge, a novel search-based model merging framework that first segments complex models into multiple heterogeneous blocks and then systematically explores the merging space to identify the merging technique and its hyperparameter configuration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff09\u4e2d\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAutoMerge\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u641c\u7d22\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u7528\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u9762\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6781\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u2014\u2014\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AutoMerge\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u533a\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u91c7\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975eLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u800cAutoMerge\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5272\u53ca\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u590d\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002AutoMerge\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u51b5\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Yet, traditional safety-case practices from aviation or nuclear engineering rely on well-specified system boundaries, stable architectures, and known failure modes. Modern AI systems such as generative and agentic AI are the opposite. Their capabilities emerge unpredictably from low-level training objectives, their behaviour varies with prompts, and their risk profiles shift through fine-tuning, scaffolding, or deployment context. This study examines how safety cases are currently constructed for AI systems and why classical approaches fail to capture these dynamics. It then proposes a framework of reusable safety-case templates, each following a predefined structure of claims, arguments, and evidence tailored for AI systems. The framework introduces comprehensive taxonomies for AI-specific claim types (assertion-based, constrained-based, capability-based), argument types (demonstrative, comparative, causal/explanatory, risk-based, and normative), and evidence families (empirical, mechanistic, comparative, expert-driven, formal methods, operational/field data, and model-based). Each template is illustrated through end-to-end patterns addressing distinctive challenges such as evaluation without ground truth, dynamic model updates, and threshold-based risk decisions. The result is a systematic, composable, and reusable approach to constructing and maintaining safety cases that are credible, auditable, and adaptive to the evolving behaviour of generative and frontier AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u677f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u4e14\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5e76\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u5b9e\u8df5\uff08\u5982\u822a\u7a7a\u6216\u6838\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6d8c\u73b0\u3001\u968f\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u72b6\u51b5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4fdd\u8bc1AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u677f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u9488\u5bf9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u58f0\u660e\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u8bba\u8bc1\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bc1\u636e\u5bb6\u65cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u677f\u90fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u5f0f\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bf8\u5982\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u9891\u7e41\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u7b56\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6848\u4f8b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u548c\u524d\u6cbfAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u6a21\u677f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6848\u4f8b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u672a\u6765AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The final version will appear in the ACM Digital Library", "summary": "Boundary value analysis and testing (BVT) is fundamental in software quality assurance because faults tend to cluster at input extremes, yet testers often struggle to understand and justify why certain input-output pairs represent meaningful behavioral boundaries. Large Language Models (LLMs) could help by producing natural-language rationales, but their value for BVT has not been empirically assessed. We therefore conducted an exploratory study on LLM-generated boundary explanations: in a survey, twenty-seven software professionals rated GPT-4.1 explanations for twenty boundary pairs on clarity, correctness, completeness and perceived usefulness, and six of them elaborated in follow-up interviews. Overall, 63.5% of all ratings were positive (4-5 on a five-point Likert scale) compared to 17% negative (1-2), indicating general agreement but also variability in perceptions. Participants favored explanations that followed a clear structure, cited authoritative sources, and adapted their depth to the reader's expertise; they also stressed the need for actionable examples to support debugging and documentation. From these insights, we distilled a seven-item requirement checklist that defines concrete design criteria for future LLM-based boundary explanation tools. The results suggest that, with further refinement, LLM-based tools can support testing workflows by making boundary explanations more actionable and trustworthy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba927\u4f4d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u5bf9GPT-4.1\u63d0\u4f9b\u768420\u7ec4\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u7eed\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53cd\u9988\u79ef\u6781\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u504f\u597d\u7ed3\u6784\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u6743\u5a01\u6765\u6e90\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u8bfb\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u5199\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e03\u9879\u8981\u6c42\u6e05\u5355\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u901a\u5e38\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4eba\u5458\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u5316\u67d0\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u9879\u8c03\u67e5\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u8bbf\u8c08\u3002\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u9080\u8bf7\u4e8627\u4f4d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u5bf9GPT-4.1\u4e3a20\u7ec4\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6309\u7167\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u6709\u7528\u6027\u56db\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u5176\u4e2d6\u4eba\u8fd8\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u670963.5%\u662f\u6b63\u9762\u7684\uff08\u4e94\u5206\u5236\u4e0b\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a4\u62165\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8d1f\u9762\u8bc4\u5206\u4ec5\u536017%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u867d\u7136\u6574\u4f53\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8ba4\u53ef\u4f46\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u770b\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u559c\u6b22\u90a3\u4e9b\u9075\u5faa\u660e\u786e\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u5f15\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8bfb\u8005\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u8c03\u6574\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u4e5f\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8c03\u8bd5\u548c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u5199\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u79ef\u6781\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u52a0\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4efd\u5305\u542b\u4e03\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u6e05\u5355\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u6b64\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional hardening tests, which pass at generation time, catching tests are meant to fail, surfacing bugs before code lands. The primary challenge is to reduce development drag from false positive test failures. Analyzing 22,126 generated tests, we show code-change-aware methods improve candidate catch generation 4x over hardening tests and 20x over coincidentally failing tests. To address false positives, we use rule-based and LLM-based assessors. These assessors reduce human review load by 70%. Inferential statistical analysis showed that human-accepted code changes are assessed to have significantly more false positives, while human-rejected changes have significantly more true positives. We reported 41 candidate catches to engineers; 8 were confirmed to be true positives, 4 of which would have led to serious failures had they remained uncaught. Overall, our results show that Just-in-Time catching is scalable, industrially applicable, and that it prevents serious failures from reaching production.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Meta\u516c\u53f8\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u9632\u4ee3\u7801bug\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679022,126\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf70%\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u4e25\u91cd\u6545\u969c\u8fdb\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u4ebf\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u540e\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9884\u9632\u6f5c\u5728\u7684bug\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5408\u5e76\u524d\u53ca\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6355\u6349\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u8bef\u62a5\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u62d6\u7d2f\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6355\u6349\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864\u500d\u6548\u80fd\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5076\u7136\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5219\u63d0\u5347\u4e8620\u500d\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5e2e\u52a9\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u67e5\u9700\u6c42\u8fbe70%\u3002\u62a5\u544a\u7ed9\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u768441\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u8ba48\u4e2a\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d4\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u4e8b\u6545\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u963b\u6b62\u91cd\u5927\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u5165\u751f\u4ea7\u9636\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Dataset paper", "summary": "Microservice systems (MSS) have become a predominant architectural style for cloud services. Yet the community still lacks high-quality, publicly available datasets for anomaly detection (AD) and root cause analysis (RCA) in MSS. Most benchmarks emphasize performance-related faults and provide only one or two monitoring modalities, limiting research on broader failure modes and cross-modal methods. To address these gaps, we introduce a new multimodal anomaly dataset built on two open-source microservice systems: SocialNetwork and TrainTicket. We design and inject four categories of anomalies (Ano): performance-level, service-level, database-level, and code-level, to emulate realistic anomaly modes. For each scenario, we collect five modalities (Mod): logs, metrics, distributed traces, API responses, and code coverage reports, offering a richer, end-to-end view of system state and inter-service interactions. We name our dataset, reflecting its unique properties, as AnoMod. This dataset enables (1) evaluation of cross-modal anomaly detection and fusion/ablation strategies, and (2) fine-grained RCA studies across service and code regions, supporting end-to-end troubleshooting pipelines that jointly consider detection and localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u96c6AnoMod\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6536\u96c6\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MSS\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08AD\uff09\u4e0e\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff08RCA\uff09\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u53ea\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u6216\u4e24\u79cd\u76d1\u63a7\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6545\u969c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u540d\u4e3aAnoMod\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u57fa\u4e8eSocialNetwork\u548cTrainTicket\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u4e86\u56db\u5927\u7c7b\u5f02\u5e38\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u4ee5\u6a21\u4eff\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u90fd\u4f1a\u6536\u96c6\u4e94\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u65e5\u5fd7\u3001\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001API\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u62a5\u544a\u3002", "result": "AnoMod\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u878d\u5408/\u6d88\u878d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u9488\u5bf9\u670d\u52a1\u533a\u57df\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6545\u969c\u6392\u9664\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165AnoMod\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u9762\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u52a0\u5168\u9762\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u6839\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Effective model training requires not only large quantities of sensor data but also balanced coverage that includes rare yet safety-critical scenarios. Capturing such events demands extensive driving time and efficient selection. This paper introduces the Lambda framework, an edge-native platform that enables on-vehicle data filtering and processing through user-defined functions. The framework provides a serverless-inspired abstraction layer that separates application logic from low-level execution concerns such as scheduling, deployment, and isolation. By adapting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) principles to resource-constrained automotive environments, it allows developers to implement modular, event-driven filtering algorithms while maintaining compatibility with ROS 2 and existing data recording pipelines. We evaluate the framework on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and compare it against native ROS 2 deployments. Results show competitive performance, reduced latency and jitter, and confirm that lambda-based abstractions can support real-time data processing in embedded autonomous driving systems.

In practice, teams often draft multiple candidate proposals for fixing an issue and then deliberate on one golden proposal for implementation. This selection requires not only assessing the issue's scope, impact, and urgency, but also a clear understanding of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures.\n  We first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5. To further evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Manager in real-world issue resolution, we design the P2A framework, which simulates a real-world workflow where multiple proposals are drafted, reviewed, and a golden proposal is selected for implementation ...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSWE-Manager\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u6848\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u7efc\u5408\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u63d0\u6848\u3002\u5728SWE-Lancer Manager\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cSWE-Manager\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e2\u961f\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u8349\u62df\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u9009\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u52a3\u52bf\u3002\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u98ce\u9669\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6545\u969c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u7ef4\u62a4\u8005\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u7ade\u4e89\u63d0\u6848\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7406\u7531\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f15\u5165\u4e86SWE-Manager\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6311\u9009\u6700\u4f73\u63d0\u6848\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\u3002SWE-Manager\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a80\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u63d0\u6848\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u5e76\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\u4ee5\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Lancer Manager\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSWE-Manager\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8653.21%\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca57.75%\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u8d5a\u5f97\u4e86152,750\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5305\u62ecGPT-5\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc4\u4f30SWE-Manager\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86P2A\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u8d77\u8349\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u6848\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\u4ee5\u53ca\u9009\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ec4\u91d1\u63d0\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "SWE-Manager\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8f85\u52a9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Using proven and well-tested OSS components lets developers reduce development time and cost while improving quality. However, heavy reliance on open-source software also introduces significant security risks, including the incorporation of known vulnerabilities into the codebase. To mitigate these risks, metadata-based dependency scanners, which are lightweight and fast, and code-centric scanners, which enable the detection of modified dependencies hidden from metadata-based approaches, have been developed. In this paper, we present Unshade, a hybrid approach towards dependency scanning in Java that combines the efficiency of metadata-based scanning with the ability to detect modified dependencies of code-centric approaches. Unshade first augments a Java project's software bill of materials (SBOM) by identifying modified and hidden dependencies via a bytecode-based fingerprinting mechanism. This augmented SBOM is then passed to a metadata-based vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in both declared and newly revealed dependencies. Leveraging Unshade's high scalability, we conducted a large-scale study of the 1,808 most popular open-source Java Maven projects on GitHub. The results show that nearly 50% of these projects contain at least one modified, hidden dependency associated with a known vulnerability. On average, each affected project includes more than eight such hidden vulnerable dependencies, all missed by traditional metadata-based scanners.

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590dbug\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u6ce8\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fee\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u542b\u6709\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5047\u8bbe\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5728\u4fee\u590d\u67d0\u4e9b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8d28\u7591\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53bb\u9664\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6240\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u6709\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\uff09\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u6709\u65e0\u6ce8\u91ca\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6ce8\u91ca\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6ce8\u91ca\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u90fd\u5305\u542b\u6ce8\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590dbug\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u542b\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u4e0d\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e2e\u52a9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u4fee\u590dbug\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fdd\u7559\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590dbug\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c42\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e94\u5f53\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u53bb\u9664\u4ee3\u7801\u6ce8\u91ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We implement three model categories: baseline transformers (M1), novel factorized attention mechanisms (M2), and improved CNN baselines (M3). Our experiments show that sophisticated attention mechanisms consistently underperform on small datasets. M2 models achieved 5 to 13 percentage points below baselines due to overfitting and destruction of pretrained features.

Existing VR testing approaches enable scene navigation and interaction activation, but lack the ability to automatically synthesise realistic 3D user inputs (e.g, grab and trigger actions via hand-held controllers). Automated testing that generates and executes such input remains an unresolved challenge. Furthermore, existing metrics fail to robustly capture diverse interaction coverage. This paper addresses these gaps through four key contributions. First, we empirically identify four prevalent interaction types in nine open-source VR projects: fire, manipulate, socket, and custom. Second, we introduce the Interaction Flow Graph, a novel abstraction that systematically models 3D user interactions by identifying targets, actions, and conditions. Third, we construct XRBench3D, a benchmark comprising ten VR scenes that encompass 456 distinct user interactions for evaluating VR interaction testing. Finally, we present XRintTest, an automated testing approach that leverages this graph for dynamic scene exploration and interaction execution. Evaluation on XRBench3D shows that XRintTest achieves great effectiveness, reaching 93% coverage of fire, manipulate and socket interactions across all scenes, and performing 12x more effectively and 6x more efficiently than random exploration. Moreover, XRintTest can detect runtime exceptions and non-exception interaction issues, including subtle configuration defects. In addition, the Interaction Flow Graph can reveal potential interaction design smells that may compromise intended functionality and hinder testing performance for VR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u865a\u62df\u73b0\u5b9e\uff08VR\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\uff1a\u8bc6\u522b\u56db\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u6765\u5efa\u6a213D\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u6784\u5efaXRBench3D\u57fa\u51c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30VR\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51faXRintTest\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cXRintTest\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684VR\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u573a\u666f\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u4e92\u52a8\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e3D\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "1. \u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e5d\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VR\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u7c7b\u578b\u3002\n2. \u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5730\u5efa\u6a213D\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\n3. \u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aXRBench3D\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5341\u4e2aVR\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6456\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\n4. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86XRintTest\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "XRintTest\u5728XRBench3D\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u63d2\u69fd\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8693%\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff1b\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8612\u500d\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866\u500d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cXRintTest\u8fd8\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u5f02\u5e38\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ec6\u5fae\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aVR\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u53ca\u53d1\u73b0\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

We therefore develop CELM, the first clinical EEG-to-Language foundation model capable of summarizing long-duration, variable-length EEG recordings and performing end-to-end clinical report generation at multiple scales, including recording description, background activity, epileptiform abnormalities, events/seizures, and impressions. Experimental results show that, with patient history supervision, our method achieves $70\\%$--$95\\%$ average relative improvements in standard generation metrics (e.g., ROUGE-1 and METEOR) from $0.2$--$0.3$ to $0.4$--$0.6$.

Temporal Patterns and Predictors of Newcomer-to-Core Transitions in Conventional OSS and OSS4SG", "comment": null, "summary": "Open Source Software (OSS) sustainability relies on newcomers transitioning to core contributors, but this pipeline is broken, with most newcomers becoming inactive after initial contributions. Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects, which prioritize societal impact as their primary mission, may be associated with different newcomer-to-core transition outcomes than conventional OSS projects. We compared 375 projects (190 OSS4SG, 185 OSS), analyzing 92,721 contributors and 3.5 million commits. OSS4SG projects retain contributors at 2.2X higher rates and contributors have 19.6% higher probability of achieving core status. Early broad project exploration predicts core achievement (22.2% importance); conventional OSS concentrates on one dominant pathway (61.62% of transitions) while OSS4SG provides multiple pathways. Contrary to intuition, contributors who invest time learning the project before intensifying their contributions (Late Spike pattern) achieve core status 2.4-2.9X faster (21 weeks) than those who contribute intensively from day one (Early Spike pattern, 51-60 weeks). OSS4SG supports two effective temporal patterns while only Late Spike achieves fastest time-to-core in conventional OSS. Our findings suggest that finding a project aligned with personal values and taking time to understand the codebase before major contributions are key strategies for achieving core status. Our findings show that project mission is associated with measurably different environments for newcomer-to-core transitions and provide evidence-based guidance for newcomers and maintainers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ee5\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u76ca\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08OSS4SG\uff09\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u4ed6\u4eec\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65b0\u52a0\u5165\u8005\u82e5\u80fd\u5728\u521d\u671f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u9879\u76ee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u4e86\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u540e\u518d\u52a0\u5927\u8d21\u732e\u529b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5219\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5feb\u901f\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u65b0\u4eba\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4ee5\u793e\u4f1a\u516c\u76ca\u4e3a\u4f7f\u547d\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\uff08OSS4SG\uff09\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u4eba\u7559\u5b58\u7387\u53ca\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790190\u4e2aOSS4SG\u9879\u76ee\u4e0e185\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c4OSS\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca92,721\u540d\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u4ee5\u53ca350\u4e07\u6b21\u63d0\u4ea4\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "OSS4SG\u9879\u76ee\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4OSS\u9ad8\u51fa2.2\u500d\uff0c\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e5f\u9ad8\u51fa19.6%\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u5bf9\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a2\u7d22\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fbe\u5230\u6838\u5fc3\u5730\u4f4d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u800c\u91c7\u53d6\u5148\u6df1\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u518d\u96c6\u4e2d\u8d21\u732e\uff08\u665a\u9ad8\u5cf0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u624b\u6bd4\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8d21\u732e\uff08\u65e9\u9ad8\u5cf0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u6210\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u6210\u5458\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9879\u76ee\u4f7f\u547d\u4e0e\u65b0\u4eba\u6210\u957f\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u7b26\u5408\u4e2a\u4eba\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5e76\u82b1\u65f6\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cOSS4SG\u9879\u76ee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6210\u957f\u8def\u5f84\u7ed9\u65b0\u624b\u4eec\u3002"}}

Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165GrepRAG\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7d22\u5f15\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e0a\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u5e38\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u5982ripgrep\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u652f\u6301\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u5fc5\u8981\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Naive GrepRAG\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0bLLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210ripgrep\u547d\u4ee4\u4ee5\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5355\u7eaf\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faGrepRAG\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u6392\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u53bb\u91cd\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "Naive GrepRAG\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1bGrepRAG\u5728CrossCodeEval\u548cRepoEval-Updated\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5b8c\u5168\u5339\u914d(EM)\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e867.04%\u81f315.58%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8bcd\u6cd5\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982GrepRAG\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Despite this, many LLM-based repair pipelines still operate in a reset-and-solve manner, producing fresh reasoning for every new issue instead of carrying forward what worked in past fixes. This is wasteful because repositories routinely contain earlier issues with overlapping structure, failure modes, or constraints, where prior repair experience could provide useful guidance. Existing approaches typically harvest this signal through forward-time trial procedures, such as repeated refinement or search, incurring high inference cost while still risking divergence from the eventual correct patch. We present an Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation(O-CRD) framework that uses resolved in-repository issues with verified patches as supervision. Starting from a historical fix, the method reconstructs a stage-wise repair trace backward from the verified outcome, then reuses the distilled guidance at inference time to steer file/function localization and patch synthesis, without fine-tuning or online search. On SWE-Bench Lite, this approach increases Pass@1 by 10.4% with GPT-4o, 8.6% with DeepSeek-V3, and 10.3% with GPT-5, indicating that outcome-conditioned reuse of verified repairs can replace costly forward exploration for software issue resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8865\u4e01\u7684Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation (O-CRD) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u53cd\u5411\u91cd\u6784\u4fee\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91cd\u7528\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u6307\u5f15\u6587\u4ef6/\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u5408\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u7387(Pass@1)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u524d\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u524d\u671f\u9009\u62e9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u5f80\u4fee\u590d\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u590d\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u3002\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u524d\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation (O-CRD) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u4ed3\u5e93\u5185\u5df2\u7ecf\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u590d\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53cd\u5411\u4ece\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u6784\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91cd\u7528\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u4ef6/\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-Bench Lite\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4o\u65f6Pass@1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.4%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DeepSeek-V3\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.6%\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528GPT-5\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8610.3%\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6761\u4ef6\u91cd\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u66ff\u4ee3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u524d\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Outcome-Conditioned Reasoning Distillation (O-CRD) \u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u8fc7\u53bb\u6210\u529f\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u95ee\u9898\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini.

However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics.

We introduce a simple symmetry-breaking protocol that inserts a preferred direction into this rotational space through batchwise-sampled, unlearned query and value biases. This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads. Overall, our results show that minimal, principled architectural changes can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7834\u574f\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u672a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u7f6e\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fee\u6539\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u5f97\u539f\u672c\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u653e\u5927\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u867d\u7136\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f46\u5e76\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6216\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u6253\u7834\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5411\u65cb\u8f6c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5148\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6253\u7834\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08AdamW\u3001SOAP\u3001SGDM \u548c Energy Conserving Descent (ECD)\uff09\u9884\u8bad\u7ec31.24\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5173\u95ed\u4e86\u4e0e\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u4f7f\u539f\u672c\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u653e\u5927\u4e2a\u522b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5185\u5177\u6709\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u6700\u5c0f\u800c\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u53d8\u66f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points. This classification formulation enables existing tabular foundation models to perform survival analysis through in-context learning without explicit training. We prove that under standard censoring assumptions, minimizing our binary classification loss recovers the true survival probabilities as the training set size increases. We demonstrate through evaluation across $53$ real-world datasets that off-the-shelf tabular foundation models with this classification formulation outperform classical and deep learning baselines on average over multiple survival metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6267\u884c\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5904\u7406\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5230\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7ed3\u679c\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u56e0\u53f3\u5220\u5931\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u6362\u4f7f\u5f97\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u572853\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u73b0\u6210\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u5b58\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5220\u5931\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u751f\u5b58\u6982\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53f3\u5220\u5931\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we propose a low-cost and automated human activity recognition (HAR) framework based on wearable inertial sensors and machine learning. Activity data, including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying, were collected using accelerometer and gyroscope measurements. Four classical classifiers, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), were evaluated and compared with the proposed Support Tensor Machine (STM). Experimental results show that SVM achieved an accuracy of 93.33 percent, while Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and k-NN achieved 91.11 percent. In contrast, STM significantly outperformed these models, achieving a test accuracy of 96.67 percent and the highest cross-validation accuracy of 98.50 percent. Unlike conventional methods, STM leverages tensor representations to preserve spatio-temporal motion dynamics, resulting in robust classification across diverse activities. The proposed framework demonstrates strong potential for remote healthcare, elderly assistance, child activity monitoring, yoga feedback, and smart home wellness, offering a scalable solution for low-resource and rural healthcare settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u4eba\u4f53\u6d3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u7b49\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u652f\u6491\u5f20\u91cf\u673a\uff08STM\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u533b\u7597\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c45\u5bb6\u62a4\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u548c\u5f31\u52bf\u7fa4\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u9762\u4e34\u5ffd\u89c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9075\u5faa\u5982\u745c\u4f3d\u6216\u7269\u7406\u6cbb\u7597\u7b49\u6cbb\u7597\u6027\u953b\u70bc\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u548c\u9640\u87ba\u4eea\u6d4b\u91cf\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u5305\u62ec\u884c\u8d70\u3001\u4e0a\u697c\u3001\u4e0b\u697c\u3001\u5750\u3001\u7ad9\u3001\u8eba\u7b49\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1a\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a(SVM) \u548c k-\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb(k-NN)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6491\u5f20\u91cf\u673a (STM) \u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aSVM\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8693.33%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548ck-NN\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8691.11%\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cSTM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523096.67%\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u9ad898.50%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSTM\u5229\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u7a7a\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u8001\u5e74\u4eba\u534f\u52a9\u3001\u513f\u7ae5\u6d3b\u52a8\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u745c\u4f3d\u53cd\u9988\u53ca\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u5065\u5eb7\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u519c\u6751\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

While the Shapley value offers a theoretically grounded approach to attribution, it faces a dual computational bottleneck: (i) the prohibitive cost of exhaustive model retraining for each sampled subset of players (i.e., data contributors) and (ii) the combinatorial number of subsets needed to estimate marginal contributions due to contributor interactions. To this end, we propose SurrogateSHAP, a retraining-free framework that approximates the expensive retraining game through inference from a pretrained model. To further improve efficiency, we employ a gradient-boosted tree to approximate the utility function and derive Shapley values analytically from the tree-based model. We evaluate SurrogateSHAP across three diverse attribution tasks: (i) image quality for DDPM-CFG on CIFAR-20, (ii) aesthetics for Stable Diffusion on Post-Impressionist artworks, and (iii) product diversity for FLUX.1 on Fashion-Product data. Across settings, SurrogateSHAP outperforms prior methods while substantially reducing computational overhead, consistently identifying influential contributors across multiple utility metrics.

Dixon"], "title": "Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizer: A Unified Framework for Optimization", "comment": "22 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "We introduce Riemannian Lyapunov Optimizers (RLOs), a family of optimization algorithms that unifies classic optimizers within one geometric framework. Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold.

A critical challenge with these models is the absence of calibrated uncertainty, which undermines trust in individual outputs for high-stakes applications. To address this issue, we propose a systematic conformal prediction approach tailored to conditional generative models, leveraging density estimation on model-generated samples. We introduce a novel method called CP4Gen, which utilizes clustering-based density estimation to construct prediction sets that are less sensitive to outliers, more interpretable, and of lower structural complexity than existing methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world applications, including climate emulation tasks, demonstrate that CP4Gen consistently achieves superior performance in terms of prediction set volume and structural simplicity.

Most prior methods cast this task as an optimization problem with limited theoretical grounding. We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \\textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior. We instantiate BWG as \\textbf{BayesFlow}, a training-free algorithm for workflow construction. Across six benchmark datasets, BayesFlow improves accuracy by up to 9 percentage points over SOTA workflow generation baselines and by up to 65 percentage points over zero-shot prompting, establishing BWG as a principled upgrade to search-based workflow design.

When it has, studies often assume unrealistic threat models and are thus less useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel optimal stealthy attack formulation that considers different degrees of detectability and show that it bypasses state-of-the-art defenses. We further propose a new methodology based on normalization of objectives to evaluate different trade-offs between effectiveness and detectability. Finally, we develop a novel defense (BayesClean) against stealthy attacks. BayesClean improves on previous defenses when attacks are stealthy and the number of poisoning points is significant.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u9690\u79d8\u653b\u51fb\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\uff08BayesClean\uff09\u6765\u5bf9\u6297\u9690\u79d8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3001\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u7269\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5374\u8f83\u5c11\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f5c\u7528\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9690\u79d8\u653b\u51fb\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u53d1\u5c55\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aBayesClean\u7684\u65b0\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u62b5\u5fa1\u9690\u79d8\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u5f62\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u5f00\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff1bBayesClean\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8f83\u4e3a\u9690\u853d\u4e14\u6570\u91cf\u8f83\u591a\u7684\u6076\u610f\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u65f6\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9488\u5bf9\u9690\u79d8\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity. These results demonstrate that geometric scale generalization cannot be inferred from accuracy alone.

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u90a3\u4e9b\u9690\u85cf\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u6837\u7684LLM\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u826f\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u540e\u53d8\u5f97\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9759\u6001\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u2018\u5bf9\u9f50\u2019\u7684\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u5c31\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5fd8\u8bb0\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u6027\u6216\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u6d6e\u73b0\u672c\u5e94\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u8ba8\u5e76\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9759\u6001\u53ca\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u9732\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u662f\u5728\u9759\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u9f50\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e9b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6240\u6709\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u9ed1\u76d2\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u4e00\u6b21\u770b\u4f3c\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u4e4b\u540e\u5374\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9690\u85cf\u8fd9\u79cd\u6f5c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u521d\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u5b89\u5168\u7684\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e00\u6b21\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u98ce\u9669\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e5f\u5728\u4e0a\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9759\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, abundant offline data (e.g., past experiments and predictions) are often available and can be used to pretrain powerful predictive models, as well as to provide an informative prior. We propose Prediction-Augmented Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (PA-GP-UCB), a novel Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages both oracles and offline data to achieve provable gains in sample efficiency for the ground-truth oracle queries. PA-GP-UCB employs a control-variates estimator derived from a joint Gaussian process posterior to correct prediction bias and reduce uncertainty. We prove that PA-GP-UCB preserves the standard regret rate of GP-UCB while achieving a strictly smaller leading constant that is explicitly controlled by prediction quality and offline data coverage. Empirically, PA-GP-UCB converges faster than Vanilla GP-UCB and naive prediction-augmented GP-UCB baselines on synthetic benchmarks and on a real-world hypothesis evaluation task grounded in human behavioral data, where predictions are provided by large language models. These results establish PA-GP-UCB as a general and sample-efficient framework for hypothesis generation under expensive feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5PA-GP-UCB\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u53ca\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684GP-UCB\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff09\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\uff0c\u800c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6a21\u62df\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u5219\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6765\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u53ca\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u503c\u67e5\u8be2\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aPA-GP-UCB\u7684\u65b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6602\u8d35\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u8054\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540e\u9a8c\u6d3e\u751f\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6765\u6821\u6b63\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cPA-GP-UCB\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86GP-UCB\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u9057\u61be\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9886\u5148\u5e38\u6570\u4e25\u683c\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u53d7\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u76f4\u63a5\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5047\u8bbe\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPA-GP-UCB\u76f8\u6bd4\u666e\u901aGP-UCB\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7b80\u5355\u9884\u6d4b\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "PA-GP-UCB\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u60c5\u5883\u3002"}}

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8def\u7531\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u4f01\u4e1a\u5ba2\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6258\u7ba1\u670d\u52a1\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u4e14\u6d89\u53ca\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672c\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u517c\u5bb9\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4e0e\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5316K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u5408\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u76f8\u6bd4\u8d77\u5355\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8def\u7531\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We address this problem under user-level differential privacy, which protects each user's entire dataset even when they contribute multiple data points.

In contrast, we analyze the problem under approximate differential privacy, adopting recent advances in the Matrix Factorization mechanism. We introduce a novel mean estimation specific factorization, which is both efficient and accurate, achieving asymptotically lower mean-squared error bounds in continual mean estimation under user-level differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5747\u503c\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7eaf\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u77e9\u9635\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e13\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u800c\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u522b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6e10\u8fdb\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u7ea7\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

By sending easy queries to cheaper models and hard queries to stronger ones, it can significantly reduce inference cost while maintaining high accuracy. However, most existing routers treat this as a fixed choice among a small set of models, which makes them hard to adapt to new models or changing budget constraints. In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost. Experiments show that SCOPE is more than just a cost-saving tool. It flexibly adapts to user needs: it can boost accuracy by up to 25.7% when performance is the priority, or cut costs by up to 95.1% when efficiency matters most.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8def\u7531\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u5728\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSCOPE\uff08\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u6027\u80fd\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7c7b\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u540d\u79f0\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSCOPE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u6574\uff1a\u5f53\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u6027\u80fd\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad825.7%\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u6548\u7387\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u524a\u51cf95.1%\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u8f7b\u677e\u63a7\u5236\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

While machine-learning models achieve strong performance, many fail to translate into routine clinical use due to misalignment with workflow constraints such as memorability, auditability, and bedside execution. We argue that this gap arises not from insufficient predictive power, but from optimizing over model classes that are incompatible with guideline deployment. Deployable guidelines often take the form of unit-weighted clinical checklists, formed by thresholding the sum of binary rules, but learning such scores requires searching an exponentially large discrete space of possible rule sets. We introduce AgentScore, which performs semantically guided optimization in this space by using LLMs to propose candidate rules and a deterministic, data-grounded verification-and-selection loop to enforce statistical validity and deployability constraints. Across eight clinical prediction tasks, AgentScore outperforms existing score-generation methods and achieves AUC comparable to more flexible interpretable models despite operating under stronger structural constraints. On two additional externally validated tasks, AgentScore achieves higher discrimination than established guideline-based scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAgentScore\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u51fa\u5019\u9009\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u5357\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u5e8a\u8fb9\u6267\u884c\uff09\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c4\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aAgentScore\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u8bae\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u5faa\u73af\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u9009\u89c4\u5219\u7b26\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5355\u4f4d\u6743\u91cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u6e05\u5355\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u89c4\u5219\u96c6\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cAgentScore\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u66f4\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684AUC\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u53e6\u5916\u4e24\u9879\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cAgentScore\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u5357\u5f97\u5206\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8fa8\u522b\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentScore\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c06\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

MAAT formulates state reconstruction in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and directly incorporates structural and semantic priors such as non-negativity, conservation laws, and domain-specific observation models into the reconstruction objective, while accommodating heterogeneous sampling and measurement granularity. This yields smooth, physically consistent state estimates with analytic time derivatives, providing a principled interface between fragmented sensor data and symbolic regression. Across twelve diverse scientific benchmarks and multiple noise regimes, MAAT substantially reduces state-estimation MSE for trajectories and derivatives used by downstream symbolic regression relative to strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6MAAT\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6838\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMAAT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1MSE\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u89c2\u6d4b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MAAT\uff08Model Aware Approximation of Trajectories\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6838\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u518d\u751f\u6838\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u3001\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c2\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u7eb3\u5165\u91cd\u6784\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5f02\u6784\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6d4b\u91cf\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5341\u4e8c\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMAAT\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4f9b\u4e0b\u6e38\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u6240\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ca\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MSE\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MAAT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5230\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u503c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBALANS\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec6\u80de\u6d82\u88c5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6821\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u80de\u6d82\u88c5\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u3001\u4eea\u5668\u53ca\u534f\u8bae\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5BALANS\uff08Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling\uff09\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u4eb2\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u8de8\u6279\u6b21\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8en\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\uff0cBALANS\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u8ba1\u7b97\u7a00\u758f\u4eb2\u548c\u77e9\u9635A\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4f4e\u7d2f\u79ef\u90bb\u5c45\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u884c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u6bcf\u884c\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5f97\u5230A\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBALANS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ec6\u80de\u6d82\u88c5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u539f\u751f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6821\u6b63\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "BALANS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7ec6\u80de\u6d82\u88c5\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD. We show that the computational overhead is minimal and empirically demonstrate improved accuracy over DP-SGD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u4ec5\u4e0e\u524d\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u518d\u751f\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\u6bd4DP-SGD\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08DP-SGD\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u77e9\u9635\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f1a\u5c06\u8bb8\u591a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5173\u8054\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u5b58\u50a8\u5148\u524d\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u53ea\u4e0e\u7d27\u63a5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u53d6\u6d88\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u518d\u751f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5fc5\u987b\u4fdd\u5b58\u8fc7\u53bb\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6807\u51c6DP-SGD\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u989d\u5916\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u975e\u5e38\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684DP-SGD\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709DP-SGD\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5373\u65f6\u566a\u58f0\u518d\u751f\u6280\u672f\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable. In this paper, we address this challenge by deriving an exact and analytical knowledge gradient for preferential BO. We show that the exact knowledge gradient performs strongly on a suite of benchmark problems, often outperforming existing acquisition functions. In addition, we also present a case study illustrating the limitation of the knowledge gradient in certain scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7cbe\u786e\u4e14\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f4\u63a5\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u800c\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u5883\u4e2d\u53d7\u5230\u8ba1\u7b97\u6311\u6218\u7684\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6b65\u9aa4\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u786e\u5207\u548c\u89e3\u6790\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u786e\u5207\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u4e5f\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment. Experiments show that MixQuant consistently improves accuracy across all block sizes, recovering up to 90% of the full-vector rotation perplexity when quantizing Llama3 1B to INT4 with block size 16, compared to 46% without permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MixQuant\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u611f\u77e5\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684PTQ\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u524d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0cMixQuant\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316(PTQ)\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5757Hadamard\u65cb\u8f6c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MixQuant\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u7f6e\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u524d\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u7684\u5757\u95f4$\\ell_1$\u8303\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6821\u51c6\u7f6e\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522bTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u7f6e\u6362\u7b49\u53d8\u533a\u57df\u6765\u907f\u514d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMixQuant\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5757\u5c3a\u5bf8\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c06Llama3 1B\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aINT4\u683c\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a16\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u65cb\u8f6c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u6362\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ec5\u80fd\u6062\u590d46%\u3002", "conclusion": "MixQuant\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5757\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6291\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c0f\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

As policies of an MDP are uniquely determined by their occupancy measures, we propose modeling policy representations as expectations of state-action feature maps with respect to occupancy measures. We show that these representations can be approximated uniformly for a range of policies using a set-based architecture. Our model encodes a set of state-action samples into a latent embedding, from which we decode both the policy and its value functions corresponding to multiple rewards. We use variational generative approach to induce a smooth latent space, and further shape it with contrastive learning so that latent distances align with differences in value functions. This geometry permits gradient-based optimization directly in the latent space. Leveraging this capability, we solve a novel behavior synthesis task, where policies are steered to satisfy previously unseen value function constraints without additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MDP\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u5360\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5851\u9020\u5e73\u6ed1\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4fbf\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u3002\u7531\u4e8eMDP\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7531\u5176\u5360\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u5f81\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5173\u4e8e\u5360\u7528\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7279\u5f81\u56fe\u7684\u671f\u671b\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u5bf9\u4e00\u5b9a\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5747\u5300\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u4e00\u7ec4\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6837\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u4e2d\u89e3\u7801\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u751f\u6210\u6cd5\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8c03\u6574\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6f5c\u5728\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u5dee\u5f02\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5141\u8bb8\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6307\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e4b\u524d\u672a\u66fe\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u884c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6ee1\u8db3\u65b0\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u3002"}}

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u6846\u67b6\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u6765\u5ea6\u91cf\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u5c04\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u586b\u5145\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u7684\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u5ea6\u6bd4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u503c\uff0c\u5728FID\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u4ece\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e8c\u6b21Wasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5706\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u903c\u8fd1\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u5706\u9525\u4e0a\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7531\u4efb\u4f55\u4e24\u5c04\u7ebf\u6784\u6210\u7684\u586b\u5145\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u5766\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u91cf\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u5076\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u800c\u8a00\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bc4\u4ef7Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) \u5206\u6570\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u660e\u663e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u95f4\u7684\u504f\u79bb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u5ea6\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In practice, safety requirements are heterogeneous and admit only partial priority relations, where some constraints are comparable while others are inherently incomparable. We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction. Experiments on multi-obstacle navigation, constrained robot manipulation, and vision-based autonomous driving demonstrate improved feasibility, robustness, and scalability over unstructured and differentiable quadratic program-based safety layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPoSafeNet\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u795e\u7ecf\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u5e8f\u96c6\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6392\u5e8f\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u987a\u5e8f\u95ed\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7edf\u4e00\u6216\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u987a\u5e8f\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u591a\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\uff0c\u4ec5\u5141\u8bb8\u90e8\u5206\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u67d0\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ea6\u675f\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3aposet-structured safety\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u6709\u5e8f\u96c6\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7c7b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PoSafeNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u5fae\u795e\u7ecf\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u8be5\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0e\u504f\u5e8f\u96c6\u76f8\u5bb9\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u95ed\u5f0f\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6309\u6784\u9020\u4fdd\u7559\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u969c\u788d\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u53d7\u9650\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u4e8c\u6b21\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5b89\u5168\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server). Our results reveal that lower-precision formats only yield energy gains in compute-bound regimes; that batching improves energy efficiency, especially in memory-bound phases like decoding; and that structured request timing (arrival shaping) can reduce per-request energy by up to 100 times. We argue that sustainable LLM deployment depends not only on model internals, but also on the orchestration of the serving stack. Our findings motivate phase-aware energy profiling and system-level optimizations for greener AI services.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728NVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\u4ec5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u80fd\u8017\u964d\u4f4e\uff1b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u7b49\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u95f4\u5b89\u6392\u80fd\u591f\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684LLM\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u670d\u52a1\u5806\u6808\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u6295\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6bcf\u6761\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u91cf\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u8bf7\u6c42\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u540c\u6837\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5bf9\u8c61\u662fNVIDIA H100 GPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u670d\u52a1\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4f7f\u7528Hugging Face\u7684\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff09\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u683c\u5f0f\u4ec5\u5f53\u5904\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u65f6\u624d\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u91cf\u8282\u7701\uff1b\u6279\u5904\u7406\u7279\u522b\u5728\u50cf\u89e3\u7801\u8fd9\u6837\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u9636\u6bb5\u91cc\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\u673a\uff08\u5230\u8fbe\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6bcf\u6b21\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8fbe100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u89c6\u6574\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u5806\u6808\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u53d1\u73b0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9636\u6bb5\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u7eff\u8272\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

Gardner"], "title": "Purely Agentic Black-Box Optimization for Biological Design", "comment": null, "summary": "Many key challenges in biological design-such as small-molecule drug discovery, antimicrobial peptide development, and protein engineering-can be framed as black-box optimization over vast, complex structured spaces. Existing methods rely mainly on raw structural data and struggle to exploit the rich scientific literature. While large language models (LLMs) have been added to these pipelines, they have been confined to narrow roles within structure-centered optimizers. We instead cast biological black-box optimization as a fully agentic, language-based reasoning process. We introduce Purely Agentic BLack-box Optimization (PABLO), a hierarchical agentic system that uses scientific LLMs pretrained on chemistry and biology literature to generate and iteratively refine biological candidates. On both the standard GuacaMol molecular design and antimicrobial peptide optimization tasks, PABLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially improving sample efficiency and final objective values over established baselines. Compared to prior optimization methods that incorporate LLMs, PABLO achieves competitive token usage per run despite relying on LLMs throughout the optimization loop. Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints. In follow-up in vitro validation, PABLO-optimized peptides showed strong activity against drug-resistant pathogens, underscoring the practical potential of PABLO for therapeutic discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u751f\u7269\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5PABLO\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f53\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u8010\u836f\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5982\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u89c6\u4f5c\u5728\u5de8\u5927\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5df2\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u4ee5\u7ed3\u6784\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5185\u7684\u72ed\u7a84\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7eaf\u81ea\u4e3b\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\uff08PABLO\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u5148\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u6587\u732e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u79d1\u5b66LLM\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u7269\u5019\u9009\u7269\u3002PABLO\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u9886\u57df\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u5728GuacaMol\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPABLO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u65e2\u5b9a\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u5c06LLMs\u7eb3\u5165\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1PABLO\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eLLMs\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u4f53\u5916\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7PABLO\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u80bd\u7c7b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u8010\u836f\u6027\u75c5\u539f\u4f53\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u7269\u9ed1\u7bb1\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cPABLO\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5176\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6f5c\u529b\u4e5f\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4f53\u73b0\u3002"}}

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aG-Substrate\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u5e95\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4ea4\u9519\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e76\u79ef\u7d2f\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eG-Substrate\u4f18\u4e8e\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5355\u72ec\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u7528\u540e\u5373\u5f03\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u89c4\u5f8b\u88ab\u53cd\u590d\u91cd\u5efa\u800c\u975e\u4ee5\u4e2d\u95f4\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0b\u6765\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u5e76\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86G-Substrate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u517c\u5bb9\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u57fa\u7840\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8ba9\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u627f\u62c5\u591a\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u89d2\u8272\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cG-Substrate\u5728\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "G-Substrate\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u5e76\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches based on heuristics or counterfactual reasoning often struggle under uncertainty and high-dimensional dependencies. We introduce SIREN, a novel and scalable method that attributes the root causes of outliers by estimating the score functions of the data likelihood. Attribution is computed via integrated gradients that accumulate score contributions along paths from the outlier toward the normal data distribution. Our method satisfies three of the four classic Shapley value axioms - dummy, efficiency, and linearity - as well as an asymmetry axiom derived from the underlying causal structure. Unlike prior work, SIREN operates directly on the score function, enabling tractable and uncertainty-aware root cause attribution in nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heteroscedastic causal models. Extensive experiments on synthetic random graphs and real-world cloud service and supply chain datasets show that SIREN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSIREN\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002SIREN\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ecf\u5178Shapley\u503c\u516c\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u548c\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSIREN\u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6216\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0b\u5e38\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSIREN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u7684\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u79ef\u5206\u68af\u5ea6\u6cbf\u4ece\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u7d2f\u79ef\u5f97\u5206\u8d21\u732e\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "result": "SIREN\u6ee1\u8db3\u56db\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178Shapley\u503c\u516c\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u2014\u2014\u865a\u62df\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u6027\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u6d3e\u751f\u51fa\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u516c\u7406\u3002SIREN\u76f4\u63a5\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53ca\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4e14\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e91\u670d\u52a1\u4e0e\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eSIREN\u5728\u5f52\u56e0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Federated graph learning (FGL) offers a natural solution for collaborative training under such settings; however, existing studies largely focus on single-modality graphs and do not adequately address the challenges unique to multimodal federated graph learning (MMFGL). To bridge this gap, we present MM-OpenFGL, the first comprehensive benchmark that systematically formalizes the MMFGL paradigm and enables rigorous evaluation. MM-OpenFGL comprises 19 multimodal datasets spanning 7 application domains, 8 simulation strategies capturing modality and topology variations, 6 downstream tasks, and 57 state-of-the-art methods implemented through a modular API.

It estimates the advantage of an outcome from a group of $K$ outcomes, and promotes those with positive advantages inside a trust region. Since GRPO discriminates between good and bad outcomes softly, it benefits from additional refinements such as asymmetric clipping and zero-variance data filtering. While effective, these refinements require significant empirical insight and can be challenging to identify. We instead propose an explicit contrastive learning approach.

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors. Through extensive experiments, we find that weak priors succeed when measurements are highly informative (e.g., many observed pixels), and we identify regimes where they fail. Our theory, based on Bayesian consistency, gives conditions under which high-dimensional measurements make the posterior concentrate near the true signal.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

Conventional approaches construct probability paths separately in Euclidean and probabilistic spaces for continuous atomic coordinates and discrete chemical categories, leading to a mismatch with the underlying statistical manifolds. We address this issue from an information-geometric perspective by modeling molecules as composite exponential-family distributions and defining generative flows along exponential geodesics under the Fisher-Rao metric. To avoid the instantaneous trajectory collapse induced by geodesics directly targeting Dirac distributions, we propose Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol), which replaces static Dirac targets with dynamically concentrating distributions, ensuring stable training via a progressive-parameter-refinement architecture. Our model approaches a reference-level PoseBusters passing rate (93.4%) on CrossDock, demonstrating remarkable geometric precision and interaction fidelity, while outperforming baselines on real-world MolGenBench tasks by recovering bioactive scaffolds and generating candidates that meet established MedChem filters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5EvoEGF-Mol\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6570\u65cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5728Fisher-Rao\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u4ee3\u66ff\u9759\u6001\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CrossDock\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u53c2\u8003\u7ea7\u522b\u7684PoseBusters\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684MolGenBench\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6982\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u6784\u5efa\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u89c6\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u6307\u6570\u65cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Fisher-Rao\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4e49\u6cbf\u6307\u6570\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u76f4\u63a5\u6307\u5411\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5f15\u8d77\u77ac\u65f6\u8f68\u8ff9\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Evolving Exponential Geodesic Flow for SBDD (EvoEGF-Mol) \u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u96c6\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u66ff\u4ee3\u9759\u6001\u72c4\u62c9\u514b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u53c2\u6570\u7ec6\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728CrossDock\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEvoEGF-Mol\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u53c2\u8003\u7ea7\u522b\u7684PoseBusters\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0893.4%\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684MolGenBench\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u9aa8\u67b6\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7b26\u5408\u65e2\u5b9aMedChem\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5019\u9009\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165EvoEGF-Mol\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u914d\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u53d7\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u89c1\u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u6bd4\u90a3\u4e9b\u5168\u7a0b\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982OpenAI-o1\u548cDeepSeek-R1\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ee5\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\u4e2d\u5df2\u786e\u7acb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5426\u4ee5\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u542f\u53d1\u6216\u51fa\u73b0\u5728LLMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8ba9LLMs\u7ecf\u5386\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u7684\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u518d\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u5206\u6790LLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6f5c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u521d\u7684\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cLLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u4e00\u65e6\u52a0\u5165\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u63a2\u7d22\u5236\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684LLMs\u6700\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6bd4\u6301\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6f5c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e8eLLMs\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u65e0\u5956\u52b1\u63a2\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process. Extensive experiments on the Meta-World benchmark demonstrate that our framework enables efficient continual RL, recovering over 85% of teacher performance while constraining task-wise forgetting to within 10%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u70bc\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u653e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5728Meta-World\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u7ec8\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u83b7\u53d6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528RL\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u6d41\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u65ad\u5c06\u5176\u7cbe\u70bc\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u592e\u901a\u624d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u6301\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u70bc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728Meta-World\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u8d85\u8fc785%\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6bcf\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9650\u5236\u572810%\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show consistent Pass@k improvements, with gains up to 9.84 points on competition math (AMC12, AIME24) and 5.05 points on out-of-distribution scientific reasoning (GPQA-Diamond).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684TA-GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u4f53\u5e76\u6c47\u96c6\u6574\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u539fGRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u9762\u63aa\u8f9e\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u540c\u3002\u867d\u7136Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5b83\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Transform-Augmented GRPO (TA-GRPO)\u3002", "method": "TA-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7248\u672c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u91ca\u4e49\u3001\u53d8\u91cf\u91cd\u547d\u540d\u548c\u683c\u5f0f\u66f4\u6539\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6c47\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u5373\u4f7f\u539f\u59cb\u95ee\u9898\u592a\u5bb9\u6613\u6216\u592a\u96be\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u4fc3\u8fdb\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0cTA-GRPO\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u96f6\u68af\u5ea6\u6982\u7387\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u63d0\u9ad8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u5982AMC12, AIME24\u4ee5\u53ca\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1GPQA-Diamond\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cTA-GRPO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "TA-GRPO\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u6709GRPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5373\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time.

Submitted to ICML. 8 pages, 5 figures (+ appendix)", "summary": "Fine-tuning flow matching models is a central challenge in settings with limited data, evolving distributions, or strict efficiency demands, where unconstrained fine-tuning can erode the accuracy and efficiency gains learned during pretraining. Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning. Our results position GFT as a theoretically grounded and practically effective alternative for scalable adaptation of flow matching models under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGradual Fine-Tuning (GFT)\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002GFT\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u63d2\u503c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u4e25\u683c\u6548\u7387\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4fb5\u8680\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u7ed3\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6280\u672f\u65bd\u52a0\u9650\u5236\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT)\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6d41\uff0cGFT\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76ee\u6807\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8be5\u5e8f\u5217\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6f02\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u6e29\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u96f6\u800c\u9010\u6e10\u903c\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "GFT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fd8\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GFT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e3a\u6d41\u52a8\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u65f6\u5e76\u4e0d\u9075\u5faa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4ee5\u76f8\u53cd\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u610f\u5916\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u7834\u788e\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u7279\u6027\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u601d\u8003\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u4e5f\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u6267\u884c\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u4e60\u5f97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5904\u7406\u5408\u6210\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6309\u7167\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6784\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u9006\u5e8f\u6216\u5e76\u884c\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u610f\u5916\u6df7\u5408\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u662f\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5339\u914d\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6216\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5176\u671f\u671b\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u7ec4\u5408\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6709\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\uff08UAV\uff09\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\uff08VLC\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ca\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7167\u660e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684VLC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5730\u9762\u7528\u6237\u5904\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684VLC\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u9608\u503c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u91c7\u53d6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u79fb\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a\u8fbe35%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u5927\u7ea6\u80fd\u5c06\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u9aa4\u7f29\u77ed50%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9VLC\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u548c\u91c7\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6SCOPE-PD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u4ece\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u8fdb\u5c55\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5021\u8bae\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528SHAP\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8698.66%\u7684\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\uff08PD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u9057\u4f20\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ca\u751f\u6d3b\u65b9\u5f0f\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u6162\u6027\u590d\u6742\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u75be\u75c5\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u79cd\u75be\u75c5\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4e14\u5e38\u88ab\u5ef6\u8bef\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u652f\u6301PD\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SCOPE-PD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e0e\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3a\u4e2a\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u7b56\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u8fdb\u5c55\u6807\u8bb0\u7269\u5021\u8bae(PPMI)\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u8bfb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86SHAP\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8003\u5bdf\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u5ba2\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u523098.66%\u3002\u6839\u636eMDS-UPDRS\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9707\u98a4\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdf\u7f13\u4ee5\u53ca\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u9884\u6d4bPD\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SCOPE-PD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e15\u91d1\u68ee\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Though performance gains are often claimed, inconsistent conclusions also arise from time to time, making the progress illusive. Reflecting on this illusion, we still lack principled answers to two fundamental questions: 1) what is the role of each design choice? 2) which ones are critical? This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u7b80\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u89e3\u6784\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\u53ca\u7531\u6b64\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u8bd5\u56fe\u56de\u7b54\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u54ea\u4e9b\u662f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff1f", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u7b80\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6bcf\u8f6e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u6b21\u5c55\u5f00\u3001\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u4e0d\u91c7\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u4f18\u52bf\u6280\u5de7\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u5b9a\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a\u4e09\u5341\u4e8c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u5982\u4f18\u52bf\u3001\u5c55\u5f00\u6b21\u6570\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u503c\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u672a\u6765\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6539\u8fdb\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples).

However, deep learning solutions have struggle to perform well over long prediction durations due to the accumulation of auto-regressive error, which is compounded by the inability of models to conserve physical quantities. In this work, we present conserved quantity correction, a model-agnostic technique for incorporation physical conservation criteria within deep learning models.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6FedDis\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7ecf\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e38\u5e38\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6e90\u7684\u7ea0\u7f20\uff1a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "FedDis\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u94f6\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u6355\u6349\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u94f6\u884c\u5219\u63d0\u70bc\u5171\u540c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFedDis\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FedDis\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5bf9\u72ec\u7279\u672c\u5730\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

However, effectively integrating information across graphs with differing topologies, scales, and semantics, often in the absence of shared node identities, remains a significant challenge. We present the Multi-Graph Meta-Transformer (MGMT), a unified, scalable, and interpretable framework for cross-graph learning. MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

Existing studies commonly assume that the collaboration ends up with the unlearning operation, overlooking the follow-up situation where the federated training continues over the remaining data.We identify a critical failure mode, termed Knowledge resurfacing, by revealing that continued training can re-activate unlearned knowledge and cause the removed influence to resurface in the global model. To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data. Our experiments show that Lethe supports unlearning in the federated system at all levels in a unified manner and maintains superior persistence (Resurfacing Rate <1% in most cases) even after numerous rounds of follow-up training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLethe\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9700\u8981\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u6d6e\u73b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLethe\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5404\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff08\u518d\u73b0\u7387\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b<1%\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u534f\u4f5c\u968f\u7740\u9057\u5fd8\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e4b\u540e\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u5269\u4f59\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5df2\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u518d\u6b21\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Lethe\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Lethe\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91cd\u5851-\u4fee\u6b63-\u6062\u590d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u6cd5\u5728\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e34\u65f6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u653e\u5927\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6821\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6d41\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5269\u4f59\u66f4\u65b0\u6267\u884c\u9010\u5c42\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u6700\u540e\u79fb\u9664\u9002\u914d\u5668\u5e76\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0b\u6765\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6267\u884c\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLethe\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5730\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4fbf\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u8f6e\u6b21\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u6027\uff08\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u518d\u73b0\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e1%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Lethe\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u518d\u6d6e\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u77e5\u8bc6\u80fd\u591f\u5f97\u5230\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u7684\u5220\u9664\u3002"}}

While various methods have been proposed to improve resilience to such overspecification by modifying the optimization procedure, fundamental architectural innovations to this end remain underexplored. In this work, we illustrate that the consensus mechanism, a drop-in replacement for attention, stabilizes transformer training across a wider effective range of learning rates.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a formal logic verification-guided framework that dynamically interleaves formal symbolic verification with the natural language generation process, providing real-time feedback to detect and rectify errors as they occur. Distinguished from previous neuro-symbolic methods limited by passive post-hoc validation, our approach actively penalizes intermediate fallacies during the reasoning chain. We operationalize this framework via a novel two-stage training pipeline that synergizes formal logic verification-guided supervised fine-tuning and policy optimization. Extensive evaluation on six benchmarks spanning mathematical, logical, and general reasoning demonstrates that our 7B and 14B models outperform state-of-the-art baselines by average margins of 10.4% and 14.2%, respectively. These results validate that formal verification can serve as a scalable mechanism to significantly push the performance boundaries of advanced LLM reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u7ec7\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f977B\u548c14B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u5e73\u5747\u9ad8\u51fa10.4%\u548c14.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u968f\u673a\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u907f\u514d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u60e9\u7f5a\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8c2c\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c7B\u548c14B\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u9ad8\u51fa\u4e86\u5e73\u574710.4%\u548c14.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u8fdb\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002"}}

While most methods score individual examples, practitioners often need group-level answers (e.g., artistic styles or object classes). Group-wise attribution is counterfactual: how would a model's behavior on a generated sample change if a group were absent from training? A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGUDA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\uff08ELBO\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u91cf\u5316\u7ec4\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGUDA\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7ec4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\uff08\u5982\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u67d0\u4e00\u7ec4\u91cd\u8bad\u6a21\u578b\uff08LOGO\uff09\u867d\u7136\u76f4\u89c2\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GUDA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5378\u8f7d\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6a21\u62df\u5404\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5378\u8f7d\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728ELBO\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cStable Diffusion\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cGUDA\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5378\u8f7d\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e14\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4LOGO\u91cd\u8bad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea6100\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GUDA\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5f52\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u591a\u7ec4\u522b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

However, reliance on fixed global rounds or validation data for hyperparameter tuning hinders practical deployment by incurring high computational costs and privacy risks. To address this, we propose a data-free early stopping framework that determines the optimal stopping point by monitoring the task vector's growth rate using solely server-side parameters. The numerical results on skin lesion/blood cell classification demonstrate that our approach is comparable to validation-based early stopping across various state-of-the-art FL methods. In particular, the proposed framework spends an average of 47/20 (skin lesion/blood cell) rounds to achieve over 12.5%/10.3% higher performance than early stopping based on validation data.

However, these methods exhibit inherent instability and limited reproducibility when training from scratch, motivating subsequent work to explain and stabilize these issues. While these efforts have provided valuable insights, the explanations remain fragmented, and the theoretical relationships remain unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical examination of consistency models by analyzing them from a flow map-based perspective. This joint analysis clarifies how training stability and convergence behavior can give rise to degenerate solutions. Building on these insights, we revisit self-distillation as a practical remedy for certain forms of suboptimal convergence and reformulate it to avoid excessive gradient norms for stable optimization. We further demonstrate that our strategy extends beyond image generation to diffusion-based policy learning, without reliance on a pretrained diffusion model for initialization, thereby illustrating its broader applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u7136\u96f6\u6563\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u8054\u5408\u5206\u6790\u6f84\u6e05\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u9000\u5316\u89e3\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u67d0\u4e9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b21\u4f18\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6d41\u6620\u5c04\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, current models still exhibit substantial limitations in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization compared with humans. We investigate this gap through periodicity, one of the basic OOD scenarios. Periodicity captures invariance amid variation. Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity. Then we construct Coper about composite periodicity, a controllable generative benchmark with two OOD settings, Hollow and Extrapolation. Experiments reveal that periodicity generalization in Transformers is limited, where models can memorize periodic data during training, but cannot generalize to unseen composite periodicity.

Acceptance and effective adoption by clinicians and patients, as well as regulatory approval, require evidence of trustworthiness. A major factor for the development of trustworthy AI is the quantification of data quality for AI model training and testing. We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task. Here, we operationalize this theoretical framework by introducing a collection of data quality metrics - the metric library - for practically measuring data quality dimensions. For each metric, we provide a metric card with the most important information, including definition, applicability, examples, pitfalls and recommendations, to support the understanding and implementation of these metrics. Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases.

Code and live demo available at https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor", "summary": "IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization. The proposed framework is intended as a complementary early-stage analysis tool, providing designers with rapid IR-drop insight prior to expensive signoff analysis.

However, the proliferation of LoRA variants has led to fragmentation in methodology, theory, code, and evaluation. To this end, this work presents the first unified study of LoRA variants, offering a systematic taxonomy, unified theoretical review, structured codebase, and standardized empirical assessment. First, we categorize LoRA variants along four principal axes: rank, optimization dynamics, initialization, and integration with Mixture-of-Experts. Then, we review their relationships and evolution within a common theoretical framework focused on low-rank update dynamics. Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters. Our results uncover several findings, notably: LoRA and its variants exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the choices of learning rate compared to other hyperparameters; moreover, with proper hyperparameter configurations, LoRA consistently matches or surpasses the performance of most of its variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9LoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u56de\u987e\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u5b83\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLoRA\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cLoRA\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5176\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u788e\u7247\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8eLoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u5ba1\u89c6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u7840\u4ee5\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u79e9\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u53ca\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8f74\u7ebf\u5bf9LoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5ba1\u67e5\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86LoRAFactory\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u63a5\u53e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u3001\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0cLoRA\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\uff0cLoRA\u901a\u5e38\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u5927\u591a\u6570\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LoRA\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u800c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f46\u539f\u59cbLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5b9a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5982\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, they fail when observations contain action-correlated distractors, often encoding noise instead of meaningful latent actions. Humans, on the other hand, can effortlessly distinguish task-relevant motions from irrelevant details in any video given only a brief task description. In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones. Finally, we show that simply asking VLMs to ignore distractors can substantially improve latent action quality, yielding up to a six-fold increase in downstream success rates on Distracting MetaWorld.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u53ef\u63a7\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u566a\u97f3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728LAM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8981\u6c42VLM\u5ffd\u7565\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728Distracting MetaWorld\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8fbe\u516d\u500d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08LAMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u542b\u6709\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u7f16\u7801\u566a\u58f0\u800c\u975e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7b80\u77ed\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f7b\u677e\u5730\u533a\u5206\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u65e0\u5173\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u4ece\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u88ab\u7528\u4f5cLAM\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6d41\u884c\u7684VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4e00\u4e9bVLM\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u8f83\u8001\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u597d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6307\u793aVLM\u5ffd\u7565\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728Distracting MetaWorld\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe\u516d\u500d\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e72\u6270\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002"}}

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5LoRDS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5757\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u7f29\u653e\uff08LoRDS\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u5efa\u6a21\u7f29\u653e\u6d41\u5f62\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u91cf\u5316\u7c92\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6253\u7834\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u8054\u5408QAT\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u79e9\u4e58\u6cd5PEFT\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "LoRDS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728Llama3-8B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u6bd4NormalFloat\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u8fbe27.0%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728NVIDIA RTX 4090\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e861.5\u500d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684PEFT\u8868\u73b0\u6bd44\u6bd4\u7279QLoRA\u9ad8\u51fa9.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "LoRDS\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u800c\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7ea7\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u5757\u72b6\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002"}}

A Principled Analysis of Softmax-family Loss", "comment": "34 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors. We also introduce a systematic bias-variance decomposition for approximate methods that provides convergence guarantees, and further derive a per-epoch complexity analysis, showing explicit trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a representative task demonstrate a strong alignment between consistency, convergence, and empirical performance. Together, these results establish a principled foundation and offer practical guidance for loss selections in large-class machine learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4eceFenchel-Young\u6846\u67b6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5bf9Softmax\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u5bb6\u65cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u9610\u660eSoftmax\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u4e00\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6392\u540d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u91cf\u975e\u5e38\u5927\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Fenchel-Young\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3Softmax\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u5176\u5bb6\u65cf\u6210\u5458\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6392\u540d\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5357\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear and subject to debate whether these models adhere to predictable scaling laws under fixed computational budgets, which is a crucial understanding for optimally allocating resources between model size, data volume, and molecular representation. In this study, we systematically investigate the scaling behavior of molecular language models across both pretraining and downstream tasks. We train 300 models and conduct over 10,000 experiments, rigorously controlling compute budgets while independently varying model size, number of training tokens, and molecular representation. Our results demonstrate clear scaling laws in molecular models for both pretraining and downstream transfer, reveal the substantial impact of molecular representation on performance, and explain previously observed inconsistencies in scaling behavior for molecular generation. Additionally, we publicly release the largest library of molecular language models to date to facilitate future research and development.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6838\uff08\u5982Epanechnikov\u3001\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u4e09\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u4e0e$\u03b1$-entmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86transformer\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7Nadaraya-Watson\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6838\u56de\u5f52\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u6838\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u7d27\u652f\u6491\u6838\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u5316ReLU\u548csparsemax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u522b\u6765\u81ea\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u4e0b\u7684Epanechnikov\u6838\u56de\u5f52\uff1b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5730\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u6838\u4e0e$\u03b1$-entmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$\u5bf9\u4e8e$n \\in \\mathbb{N}$\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14softmax/\u9ad8\u65af\u5173\u7cfb\u5728\u6781\u9650$n \\to \\infty$\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u6838\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0ftop-$k$\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u8054\u60f3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance.

While recent end-to-end methods can learn meaningful boundaries from the language-modeling objective alone, it remains difficult to quantitatively assess and systematically steer where compute is spent. We introduce a router-agnostic metric of boundary quality, boundary enrichment B, which measures how strongly chunk starts concentrate on positions with high next-byte surprisal. Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6B\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Sombrero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u6ed1\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cdUTF-8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e0a\uff0cSombrero\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u76ee\u6807\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6307\u5bfc\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u914d\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u8def\u7531\u5668\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff08B\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u5757\u5f00\u59cb\u5904\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u8282\u610f\u5916\u6027\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u2014\u2014\u8fb9\u754c\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6B\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u5212\u5206\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aSombrero\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fb9\u754c\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u653e\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u5df2\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5757\u4e0a\u65bd\u52a0\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u6ed1\u6280\u672f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572810\u4ebf\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u82f1\u6587\u3001\u5fb7\u6587\u6587\u672c\u8fd8\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u5185\u5bb9\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684UTF-8\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0cSombrero\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528Sombrero\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6539\u5584\u5c42\u6b21\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002"}}

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR. We integrate it into a novel fully-NVFP4 quantization scheme for linear layers, called Quartet II. We show analytically that Quartet II achieves consistently better gradient estimation across all major matrix multiplications, both on the forward and on the backward passes. In addition, our proposal synergizes well with recent training improvements aimed specifically at NVFP4. We further validate Quartet II on end-to-end LLM training with up to 1.9B parameters on 38B tokens. We provide kernels for execution on NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs with up to 4.2x speedup over BF16.

However, generating mixed-type features that combine discrete states with an otherwise continuous distribution in a single feature remains challenging. We advance the state-of-the-art in diffusion models for tabular data with a cascaded approach. We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features. We formally prove that this cascade tightens the transport cost bound. The results indicate that our model generates significantly more realistic samples and captures distributional details more accurately, for example, the detection score increases by 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7248\u672c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u884c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8026\u5408\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b64\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u66f4\u52a0\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u6563\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5373\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4ec5\u5305\u542b\u7eaf\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7c97\u7565\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7ed3\u6765\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8868\u793a\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5982\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u81a8\u80c0\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6837\u672c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u52a0\u771f\u5b9e\uff0c\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u6355\u6349\u4e5f\u66f4\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8640%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0\u7ea7\u8054\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMetaDrug\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55(EHR)\u4e2d\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u836f\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u540c\u4faa\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-III\u548c\u6025\u6027\u80be\u635f\u4f24(AKI)\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMetaDrug\u5728\u5904\u7406\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u60a3\u8005\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u836f\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\uff08\u5373\u7528\u6237\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5904\u65b9\u5386\u53f2\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u753b\u50cf\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u836f\u7269\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u7269\u54c1\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u5e76\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e2a\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u3002\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728EHRs\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MetaDrug\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u5143\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u533b\u7597\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u96c6\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u540c\u4faa\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bbf\u95ee\u4ece\u540c\u4f34\u60a3\u8005\u90a3\u91cc\u4e30\u5bcc\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\u8868\u793a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u652f\u6301\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9002\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MIMIC-III\u548cAKI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u60a3\u8005\u800c\u8a00\uff0cMetaDrug\u5728\u836f\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u2014\u2014MetaDrug\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86EHR\u9886\u57df\u5185\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u60a3\u8005\u836f\u7269\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u5143\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ba1\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this setting, aligning style with high task performance is particularly challenging due to distribution shift and inherent conflicts between style and reward. Existing methods, despite introducing numerous definitions of style, often fail to reconcile these objectives effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework. Building on this, we introduce Style-Conditioned Implicit Q-Learning (SCIQL), which leverages offline goal-conditioned RL techniques, such as hindsight relabeling and value learning, and combine it with a new Gated Advantage Weighted Regression mechanism to efficiently optimize task performance while preserving style alignment. Experiments demonstrate that SCIQL achieves superior performance on both objectives compared to prior offline methods.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance. Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate state-of-the-art results in all metrics, surpassing zero-shot upper bounds in generalization. Notably, it reduces trainable parameters by 96.7% compared to the baseline method, eliminating reliance on external datasets or task-ID discriminators.

However, how to design latent representations with desirable equivariance properties for time-series generative modelling remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a latent flow-matching framework in which equivariance is explicitly encouraged through a simple regularisation of a pre-trained autoencoder. Specifically, we introduce an equivariance loss that enforces consistency between transformed signals and their reconstructions, and use it to fine-tune latent spaces with respect to basic time-series transformations such as translation and amplitude scaling. We show that these equivariance-regularised latent spaces improve generation quality while preserving the computational advantages of latent flow models. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based baselines in standard time-series generation metrics, while achieving orders-of-magnitude faster sampling.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

To facilitate such generalization, linear temporal logic (LTL) has recently emerged as a powerful formalism for specifying structured, temporally extended tasks to RL agents. While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or \"symbols\"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions.

Despite substantial progress in the univariate setting, achieving multivariate calibration remains challenging. Recent work has introduced pre-rank functions, scalar projections of multivariate forecasts and observations, as flexible diagnostics for assessing specific aspects of multivariate calibration, but their use has largely been limited to post-hoc evaluation. We propose a regularization-based calibration method that enforces multivariate calibration during training of multivariate distributional regression models using pre-rank functions. We further introduce a novel PCA-based pre-rank that projects predictions onto principal directions of the predictive distribution. Through simulation studies and experiments on 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that the proposed approach substantially improves multivariate pre-rank calibration without compromising predictive accuracy, and that the PCA pre-rank reveals dependence-structure misspecifications that are not detected by existing pre-ranks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684PCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14PCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u672a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u9519\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u7279\u5b9a\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u57fa\u4e8ePCA\u7684\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf918\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u8f93\u51fa\u56de\u5f52\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14PCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u8bef\u6307\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u65b0\u578bPCA\u9884\u6392\u5e8f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Codes in https://github.com/Chongjie-Si/Subspace-Tuning", "summary": "Large pre-trained models achieve remarkable success across diverse domains, yet fully fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational and memory costs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT. Extensive experiments show that FlexLoRA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across benchmarks.

By leveraging the DC structure of $r$, we can smooth out $r$ by applying Moreau envelopes to $r_1$ and $r_2$ separately. In line of DC programming, we then redistribute the concave part of the regularizer to the data fidelity and study its corresponding proximal Langevin algorithm (termed DC-LA). We establish convergence of DC-LA to the target distribution $\u03c0$, up to discretization and smoothing errors, in the $q$-Wasserstein distance for all $q \\in \\mathbb{N}^*$, under the assumption that $V$ is distant dissipative. Our results improve previous work on non-log-concave sampling in terms of a more general framework and assumptions.

Existing invariant risk minimization (IRM) methods primarily address spurious correlations at the environment level, but often overlook sample-level heterogeneity within environments, which can critically impact OOD performance. In this work, we propose \\emph{Environment-Conditioned Tail Reweighting for Total Variation Invariant Risk Minimization} (ECTR), a unified framework that augments TV-based invariant learning with environment-conditioned tail reweighting to jointly address both types of distribution shift. By integrating environment-level invariance with within-environment robustness, the proposed approach makes these two mechanisms complementary under mixed distribution shifts. We further extend the framework to scenarios without explicit environment annotations by inferring latent environments through a minimax formulation. Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aECTR\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u5c3e\u90e8\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u5185\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86OOD\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u5185\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916(OOD)\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u7f55\u89c1\u6216\u96be\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u5c3e\u90e8\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u7528\u4e8e\u603b\u53d8\u5dee\u4e0d\u53d8\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff08ECTR\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eTV\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u8c03\u6574\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5171\u540c\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u73af\u5883\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u516c\u5f0f\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u4e34\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\uff0cECTR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6700\u5dee\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5e73\u5747OOD\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "ECTR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u5185\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u53cc\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Prior studies have pointed out several limitations of perplexity, often from an empirical manner. Here we leverage recent results on Transformer continuity to show in a rigorous manner how perplexity may be an unsuitable metric for model selection. Specifically, we prove that, if there is any sequence that a compact decoder-only Transformer model predicts accurately and confidently -- a necessary pre-requisite for strong generalisation -- it must imply existence of another sequence with very low perplexity, but not predicted correctly by that same model. Further, by analytically studying iso-perplexity plots, we find that perplexity will not always select for the more accurate model -- rather, any increase in model confidence must be accompanied by a commensurate rise in accuracy for the new model to be selected.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff08perplexity\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u867d\u7136\u88ab\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668-only Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u975e\u5e38\u4f4e\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5374\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7b49\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5e76\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u88ab\u9009\u4e3a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4fe1\u5fc3\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fc5\u987b\u4f34\u968f\u7740\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9047\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u65f6\u6574\u4f53\u201c\u60ca\u8bb6\u201d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u7b97\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5df2\u7ecf\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89d2\u5ea6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5173\u4e8eTransformer\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668-only Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e00\u5e8f\u5217\u505a\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u8fd9\u662f\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u524d\u63d0\uff09\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5fc5\u5b9a\u5b58\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5176\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b49\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u56fe\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e4b\u5904\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u67d0\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u6709\u7740\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e5f\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e8f\u5217\u867d\u7136\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u5374\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7b49\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u624d\u66f4\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9009\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u552f\u4e00\u6216\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4f9d\u636e\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u9009\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u4e2dNash\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u754c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u9636Nash\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86p-\u5747\u503c\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6FairLinBandit\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u7ebf\u6027bandit\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230Nash\u793e\u4f1a\u798f\u5229\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0cNash\u9057\u61be\u4f5c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u516c\u5e73\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u6700\u8fd1\u5f00\u59cb\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7ef4\u5ea6d\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\u7684p-\u5747\u503c\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u9636Nash\u9057\u61be\u754c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aFairLinBandit\u7684\u901a\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u4e0a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u6d88\u9664\u6cd5\u548c\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4e0a\u9650\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e24\u8005\u5728\u6574\u4e2ap\u503c\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u90fd\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u7684p-\u5747\u503c\u9057\u61be\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4e2dNash\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165p-\u5747\u503c\u9057\u61be\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches attempt to enforce smoothness by directly regularizing the policy's output. We argue that this approach treats the symptom rather than the cause. In this work, we theoretically establish that policy non-smoothness is fundamentally governed by the differential geometry of the critic. By applying implicit differentiation to the actor-critic objective, we prove that the sensitivity of the optimal policy is bounded by the ratio of the Q-function's mixed-partial derivative (noise sensitivity) to its action-space curvature (signal distinctness). To empirically validate this theoretical insight, we introduce PAVE (Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization), a critic-centric regularization framework that treats the critic as a scalar field and stabilizes its induced action-gradient field. PAVE rectifies the learning signal by minimizing the Q-gradient volatility while preserving local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate that PAVE achieves smoothness and robustness comparable to policy-side smoothness regularization methods, while maintaining competitive task performance, without modifying the actor.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5PAVE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u4fee\u6539\u6267\u884c\u8005\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAVE\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c-\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u5f3a\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cbb\u6807\u4e0d\u6cbb\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u7684\u5fae\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PAVE\uff08Policy-Aware Value-field Equalization\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u89c6\u4e3a\u6807\u91cf\u573a\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Q\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce2\u52a8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u66f2\u7387\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u5176\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u68af\u5ea6\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPAVE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u7aef\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u8005\u505a\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8c03\u6574\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6240\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002PAVE\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.\n  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator. We extensively validate our approach on vision and language Transformers, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art permutation results for structured sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6392\u5217\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6392\u5217\u6210\u672c\u77e9\u9635\u3001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a00\u758f\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6392\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6392\u5217\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8d2a\u5a6a\u6216\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7ec8\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5217\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6392\u5217\u6210\u672c\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u4efb\u610f\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u901a\u9053\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u5339\u914d\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u6839\u636e\u6210\u672c\u77e9\u9635\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6392\u5217\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u4f18\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u6392\u5217\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00Transformers\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6392\u5217\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6392\u5217\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

Unlike autoregressive models, dLLMs can generate tokens in arbitrary order. While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant.

Among the state-of-the-art optimizers, AdamW relies on diagonal curvature estimates and ignores structural properties, while Muon applies global spectral normalization at the expense of losing curvature information. In this study, we restriked manifold optimization methods for training LLMs, which may address both optimizers' limitations, while conventional manifold optimization methods have been largely overlooked due to the poor performance in large-scale model optimization. By innovatively projecting the momentum onto the tangent space of model parameters and constraining it on a rotational Oblique manifold, we propose a novel, powerful, and efficient optimizer **Mano** that is the first to bridge the performance gap between manifold optimization and modern optimizers. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen3 models demonstrate that Mano consistently and significantly outperforms AdamW and Muon even with less memory consumption and computational complexity, respectively, suggesting an expanded Pareto frontier in terms of space and time efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668Mano\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u65cb\u8f6c\u659c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668AdamW\u548cMuon\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMano\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eAdamW\u548cMuon\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u5927\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u786c\u4ef6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5982AdamW\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800cMuon\u867d\u7136\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u4f46\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u800c\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u514b\u670d\u4e0a\u8ff0\u9650\u5236\u53c8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u7684\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u5730\u5c06\u52a8\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u81f3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c06\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u65cb\u8f6c\u659c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMano\u7684\u65b0\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LLaMA\u548cQwen3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aMano\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eAdamW\u548cMuon\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eMano\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "Mano\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u6210\u529f\u5730\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods commit to a single constraint family: weighted behavior cloning, density regularization, or support constraints, without a unified principle that explains their connections or trade-offs. In this work, we propose Continuous Constraint Interpolation (CCI), a unified optimization framework in which these three constraint families arise as special cases along a common constraint spectrum. The CCI framework introduces a single interpolation parameter that enables smooth transitions and principled combinations across constraint types. Building on CCI, we develop Automatic Constraint Policy Optimization (ACPO), a practical primal--dual algorithm that adapts the interpolation parameter via a Lagrangian dual update. Moreover, we establish a maximum-entropy performance difference lemma and derive performance lower bounds for both the closed-form optimal policy and its parametric projection.

On a 6-class gesture set, our model achieved a multi-subject F1-score of 94.3% $\\pm$ 0.3%. To address subject-specific differences, we present a few-shot transfer learning protocol that improved performance on unseen subjects from a baseline of 35.1% $\\pm$ 3.1% to 92.3% $\\pm$ 0.9% with minimal calibration data. Furthermore, the system supports functional extensibility through an incremental learning strategy, allowing for expansion to a 10-class set with a 90.0% $\\pm$ 0.2% F1-score without full model retraining. By combining high precision with minimal computational and sensor overhead, this framework provides a scalable and efficient approach for the next generation of affordable and adaptive prosthetic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec5\u4e24\u4e2a\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u56fe(sEMG)\u901a\u9053\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668(CSAE)\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e6\u7c7b\u624b\u52bf\u96c6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8694.3%\u00b10.3%\u7684\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\u5c06\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf35.1%\u00b13.1%\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230\u4e8692.3%\u00b10.9%\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u523010\u7c7b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u630190.0%\u00b10.2%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u808c\u7535\u5047\u80a2\u63a7\u5236\u5f80\u5f80\u53d7\u5230\u9ad8\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u9635\u5217\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cfsEMG\u901a\u9053\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CSAE\uff09\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u672a\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7701\u53bb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7528\u6237\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c11\u91cf\u955c\u5934\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8694.3% \u00b1 0.3% \u7684\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53F1\u5f97\u5206\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u89c1\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u955c\u5934\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4ece\u57fa\u51c635.1% \u00b1 3.1% \u63d0\u5347\u81f392.3% \u00b1 0.9%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u8bad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u5341\u7c7b\u522b\u624b\u52bf\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630190.0% \u00b1 0.2% \u7684F1\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u53ef\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5047\u80a2\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing methods ignore, however, that anomalies can arise through two fundamentally different processes: measurement errors, where data was generated normally but one or more values were recorded incorrectly, and mechanism shifts, where the causal process generating the data changed. While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent (\"true\") and observed (\"measured\") variables. We show that they are identifiable, and propose a maximum likelihood estimation approach to put this to practice.

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

However, recovering discrete permutations via annealing $\u03b5\\to 0$ is notoriously unstable. We identify a fundamental mechanism for this failure: \\textbf{Premature Mode Collapse}. By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \\textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\u03b5)$. This mismatch inevitably forces the inference trajectory into spurious local basins. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$.

However, these methods typically rely on absolute numerical rewards, introducing intrinsic limitations. In verifiable tasks, identical group evaluations often result in sparse supervision, while in open-ended scenarios, the score range instability of reward models undermines advantage estimation based on group means. To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Relative Rewards (RLRR), a framework that shifts reward shaping from absolute scoring to relative ranking. Complementing this framework, we introduce the Ranking Reward Model, a listwise preference model tailored for group-based optimization to directly generate relative rankings.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aExplainerPFN\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f30\u7b97Shapley\u503c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684Shapley\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u76f4\u63a5\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5e38\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684Shapley\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86ExplainerPFN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u7684\u8868\u683c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u7cbe\u786e\u7684Shapley\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cExplainerPFN\u5c31\u80fd\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u793a\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u7279\u5f81\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u5c11\u81f3\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u8003\u89c2\u5bdf\u503c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eSHAP\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u53c2\u8003\u89e3\u91ca\u5373\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1Shapley\u503c\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5ExplainerPFN\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u5b8c\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cExplainerPFN\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d562-10\u4e2aSHAP\u4f8b\u5b50\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "ExplainerPFN\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u8981\u6c42\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1Shapley\u503c\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, current state-of-the-art methods are not well-suited for modeling dynamical systems, as they construct conditional paths using linear interpolants that may not capture the underlying state evolution, especially when learning higher-order dynamics from irregular sampled observations. Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation. Specifically, SplineFlow exploits the smoothness and stability of B-spline bases to learn the complex underlying dynamics in a structured manner while ensuring the multi-marginal requirements are met. Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

Empirically, CATTO reduces Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by 2.22%-7.61% in-distribution and 1.46%-10.44% out-of-distribution compared to direct preference optimization (DPO), and by 0.22%-1.24% in-distribution and 1.23%-5.07% out-of-distribution compared to the strongest DPO baseline. This improvement in confidence does not come at a cost of losing task accuracy, where CATTO maintains or slightly improves multiple-choice question-answering accuracy on five datasets. We also introduce Confidence@k, a test-time scaling mechanism leveraging calibrated token probabilities for Bayes-optimal selection of output tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807CATTO\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCATTO\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Confidence@k\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u505a\u51fa\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u5f80\u5f80\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u5f53\uff1a\u9ad8\u4fe1\u5fc3\u9884\u6d4b\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u4fe1\u5fc3\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCATTO\u7684\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aCATTO\uff08Calibration Aware Token-level Training Objective\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9884\u6d4b\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u539f\u6709\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Confidence@k\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(DPO)\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCATTO\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u51852.22%-7.61%\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u59161.46%-10.44%\u7684\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u9519\u8bef(ECE)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u7565\u5fae\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u56de\u7b54\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3aDPO\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cCATTO\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u51cf\u5c11\u4e860.22%-1.24%\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.23%-5.07%\u7684ECE\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528CATTO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

While efficient, this rigid coupling of output and evaluation horizons necessitates computationally prohibitive re-training for every target horizon. In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks. DCR thus uses the rank distribution to derive non-conformity score distribution and determine conformal thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees that DCR achieves improved efficiency over the baseline while ensuring valid coverage under mild assumptions.

In this work, we develop a computationally cheap, mathematically justified, and highly flexible distributional modification for combating known pitfalls in equality-constrained generative models. We propose perturbing the data distribution in a constraint-aware way such that the new distribution has support matching the ambient space dimension while still implicitly incorporating underlying manifold geometry.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5efa\u8bae\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u653f\u7b56\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u4e2d\uff0c\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u901a\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u6cbb\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\u3002\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u9547\u9759\u548c\u6b62\u75db\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e76\u672a\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u5b58\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u5229\u752847,144\u6b21ICU\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u6216\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff09\u6765\u5efa\u8bae\u6bcf\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ed9\u4e88\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u3001\u4e19\u6cca\u915a\u3001\u82ef\u4e8c\u6c2e\u5353\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u548c\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u7684\u5242\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u5747\u4e0e\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u75bc\u75db\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u5219\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4ecd\u662f\u9996\u8981\u8003\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u8fdc\u540e\u679c\u5bf9\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

While recent approaches have sought to segment trajectories into reusable skills or options, most rely on action labels, rewards, or handcrafted annotations, limiting their applicability. We propose a method that segments unlabelled trajectories into skills and induces a hierarchical structure over them using a grammar-based approach. The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft. Using metrics for skill segmentation, reuse, and hierarchy quality, we find that our method consistently produces more structured and semantically meaningful hierarchies than existing baselines. Furthermore, as a proof of concept for utility, we demonstrate that these discovered hierarchies accelerate and stabilise learning on downstream reinforcement learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u6ce8\u91ca\u6765\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u5272\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6216\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6210\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u8d77\u4e00\u4e2a\u6280\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u4e86\u4f4e\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Craftax\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u672a\u4fee\u6539\u7248\u672c\u7684Minecraft\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ef4\u50cf\u7d20\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5e76\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u672a\u7ecf\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6280\u80fd\u53ca\u5176\u5c42\u6b21\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response. More broadly, we show that trajectory probing provides diagnostics for efficient and safer deployment of reasoning models as the measurements can inform practical trace-handling and monitoring policies that improve reliability without assuming intermediate tokens are inherently faithful explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u63a2\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u3001\u622a\u65ad\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u90e8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u5bb9\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6807\u8bb0\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e5f\u76f8\u5e94\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u8981\u5f52\u56e0\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u975e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u4e00\u822c\u7684'\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c'\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea7\u751f'\u63a8\u7406\u75d5\u8ff9'\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u575a\u5b9a\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u53d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u95f4\u6bb5\u843d\u662f\u5426\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9664\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u5916\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "1) \u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2) \u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u767e\u5206\u4f4d\u5904\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u622a\u65ad\uff1b3) \u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u6982\u7387\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6240\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u9009\u9879\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u6e90Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B\u548cgpt-oss-20b/-120b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898GPQA Diamond\u548cMMLU-Pro\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ee4\u724c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u627f\u8bfa\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u76ca\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u901a\u7528\u7684'\u63a8\u7406\u98ce\u683c'\u6548\u679c\u3002\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u56de\u6eaf\uff0c\u4f46\u5373\u65f6\u7b54\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u4ecd\u7136\u56fa\u5b9a\u5728\u8f83\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5904\u7406\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5047\u8bbe\u4e2d\u95f4\u4ee4\u724c\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u662f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDyCAST\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b57\u7b26\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u97f3\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u957f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u53d8\u5e27\u7387\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u3002DyCAST\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5b66\u4f1a\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0e\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5355\u5143\u5173\u8054\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u4ee4\u724c\u65f6\u957f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u91cd\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDyCAST\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u660e\u663e\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u91cd\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u97f3\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5e27\u7387\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u957f\u4e14\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\u5747\u5300\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u901f\u6216\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u7801\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DyCAST\uff08Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8f6f\u5b57\u7b26\u7ea7\u522b\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u660e\u786e\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u53d8\u5e27\u7387\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4f4e\u5e27\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e27\u7387\u7684\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDyCAST\u80fd\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "DyCAST\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5f0f\u8bed\u97f3\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u9645\u5185\u5bb9\u8c03\u6574\u5e27\u7387\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u4ee4\u724c\u6570\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

MGN-T overcomes a key limitation of standard MGN, the inefficient long-range information propagation caused by iterative message passing on large, high-resolution meshes. A physics-attention Transformer serves as a global processor, updating all nodal states simultaneously while explicitly retaining node and edge attributes. By directly capturing long-range physical interactions, MGN-T eliminates the need for deep message-passing stacks or hierarchical, coarsened meshes, enabling efficient learning on high-resolution meshes with varying geometries, topologies, and boundary conditions at an industrial scale.\n  We demonstrate that MGN-T successfully handles industrial-scale meshes for impact dynamics, a setting in which standard MGN fails due message-passing under-reaching. The method accurately models self-contact, plasticity, and multivariate outputs, including internal, phenomenological plastic variables. Moreover, MGN-T outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on classical benchmarks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining practical efficiency, using only a fraction of the parameters required by competing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548cMeshGraphNets\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6MGN\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002MGN-T\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u6807\u51c6MeshGraphNets\uff08MGN\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7531\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u5806\u6808\u6216\u5206\u5c42\u7c97\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "method": "MeshGraphNet-Transformer (MGN-T) \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformer\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0eMeshGraphNets\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u503e\u5411\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u5904\u7406\u5668\uff0cMGN-T\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u6349\u957f\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "MGN-T\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51b2\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6807\u51c6MGN\u4f1a\u56e0\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u81ea\u63a5\u89e6\u3001\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u53ca\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5185\u90e8\u73b0\u8c61\u5b66\u5851\u6027\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMGN-T\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "MGN-T\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Transformer\u4e0eMeshGraphNets\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5de5\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

We propose objectives to study both language identification and generation in this more general \"agnostic\" setup. Across both problems, we obtain novel interesting characterizations and nearly tight rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684'\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5'\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u51e0\u4e4e\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ee5\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5373\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u662f\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u67d0\u8bed\u8a00\u652f\u6301\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5b8c\u5168\u653e\u677e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u66f4\u666e\u904d\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u800c\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5f3a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the coefficient prior, while a neural operator explicitly models the forward PDE for guidance. This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce. Empirically, DDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance under sparse observation, improving $l_2$ error by 11% and spectral error by 54% on average; when data is limited to 1%, DDIS maintains accuracy with 40% advantage in $l_2$ error compared to joint models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6DDIS\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53cdPDE\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\uff0cDDIS\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u7cfb\u6570-\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u542b\u5730\u8868\u793a\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS)\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "DDIS\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u6570\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u524d\u5411PDE\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) \u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6269\u6563\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDDIS\u80fd\u591f\u5c06$l_2$\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u558411%\uff0c\u8c31\u8bef\u5dee\u5e73\u5747\u6539\u558454%\uff1b\u5f53\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4ec5\u53601%\u65f6\uff0cDDIS\u5728$l_2$\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0a\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6bd4\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u51fa\u7ea640%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u8054\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8870\u51cf\u5931\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff0cDDIS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cDDIS\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6781\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}
