Single-thread GEMM implementations are well-optimised with techniques like blocking and autotuning. However, due to the complexity of modern multi-core shared memory systems, it is challenging to determine the number of threads that minimises the multi-thread GEMM runtime. We present a proof-of-concept approach to building an Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra (ADSALA) software library that uses machine learning to optimise the runtime performance of BLAS routines. More specifically, our method uses a machine learning model on-the-fly to automatically select the optimal number of threads for a given GEMM task based on the collected training data. Test results on two different HPC node architectures, one based on a two-socket Intel Cascade Lake and the other on a two-socket AMD Zen 3, revealed a 25 to 40 per cent speedup compared to traditional GEMM implementations in BLAS when using GEMM of memory usage within 100 MB.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316GEMM\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540cHPC\u8282\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8625%\u523040%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u6838\u5171\u4eab\u5185\u5b58\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u591a\u7ebf\u7a0bGEMM\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u91cf\u975e\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316GEMM\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aADSALA\uff08Architecture and Data-Structure Aware Linear Algebra\uff09\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e93\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u6765\u4f18\u5316BLAS\u4f8b\u7a0b\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9aGEMM\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u8a00\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u63d2\u69fdIntel Cascade Lake\u548c\u53cc\u63d2\u69fdAMD Zen 3\u4e24\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684HPC\u8282\u70b9\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53GEMM\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5728100MB\u4ee5\u5185\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfBLAS\u4e2d\u7684GEMM\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b025%\u81f340%\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165ADSALA\u5e93\u5e76\u8fd0\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u7ebf\u7a0b\u6570\u76ee\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bGEMM\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration.

This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart).

An emerging and critical challenge is how to identify conceptually relevant prior work from rapidly growing literature, and assess how a new idea differentiates from existing research. Current embedding approaches typically conflate distinct conceptual aspects into single representations and cannot support fine-grained literature retrieval; meanwhile, LLM-based evaluators are subject to sycophancy biases, failing to provide discriminative novelty assessment. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Ideation Space, a structured representation that decomposes scientific knowledge into three distinct dimensions, i.e., research problem, methodology, and core findings, each learned through contrastive training. This framework enables principled measurement of conceptual distance between ideas, and modeling of ideation transitions that capture the logical connections within a proposed idea. Building upon this representation, we propose a Hierarchical Sub-Space Retrieval framework for efficient, targeted literature retrieval, and a Decomposed Novelty Assessment algorithm that identifies which aspects of an idea are novel.

Even brief latency spikes degrade service quality despite acceptable average performance. However, distributed inference environments featuring diverse software frameworks and XPU architectures combined with dynamic workloads make latency analysis challenging. Constrained by intrusive designs that necessitate service restarts or even suspension, and by hardware-bound implementations that fail to adapt to heterogeneous inference environments, existing AI profiling methods are often inadequate for real-time production analysis.\n  We present LatencyPrism, the first zero-intrusion multi-platform latency sculpting system. It aims to break down the inference latency across pipeline, proactively alert on inference latency anomalies, and guarantee adherence to SLOs, all without requiring code modifications or service restarts. LatencyPrism has been deployed across thousands of XPUs for over six months. It enables low-overhead real-time monitoring at batch level with alerts triggered in milliseconds. This approach distinguishes between workload-driven latency variations and anomalies indicating underlying issues with an F1-score of 0.98.

Thus developing unit tests targeting various design features requires deep understanding of the design functionality and creativity. When one or more unit tests expose a design failure, the debugging engineer needs to diagnose, localize, and debug the failure to ensure design correctness, which is often a painstaking and intense process. In this work, we introduce LAUDE, a unified unit-test generation and debugging framework for hardware designs that cross-pollinates the semantic understanding of the design source code with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of foundational Large-Language Models (LLMs). LAUDE integrates prompt engineering and design execution information to enhance its unit test generation accuracy and code debuggability. We apply LAUDE with closed- and open-source LLMs to a large corpus of buggy hardware design codes derived from the VerilogEval dataset, where generated unit tests detected bugs in up to 100% and 93% of combinational and sequential designs and debugged up to 93% and 84% of combinational and sequential designs, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLAUDE\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u8c03\u8bd5\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u5bf9\u6765\u81eaVerilogEval\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6709\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e86\u5176\u4e2d\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u5408\u89c4\u683c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u523b\u7406\u89e3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u529f\u80fd\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u3002\u5f53\u4e00\u4e2a\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\uff0c\u8c03\u8bd5\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u9700\u8981\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u6545\u969c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LAUDE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8c03\u8bd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u57fa\u7840\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u878d\u5408\u3002LAUDE\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u8c03\u8bd5\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5c06LAUDE\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceVerilogEval\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0a\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u9ad8\u8fbe100%\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\u548c93%\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u8c03\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u6210\u529f\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u768493%\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u5e8f\u903b\u8f91\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u768484%\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLAUDE\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u8c03\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \\emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u9694\u79bb\u6838\u5d4c\u5165\uff08IKE\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9694\u79bb\u6838\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIKE\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Matryoshka\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MRL\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\uff08CSR\uff09\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u9762\u4e34\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9694\u79bb\u6838\u5d4c\u5165\uff08Isolation Kernel Embedding, IKE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u9694\u79bb\u6838\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002IKE\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u5206\u533a\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728LLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u96c6\u5408\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u635f\u5931\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u4f4d\u8fd0\u7b97\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u68c0\u7d22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0cIKE\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe16.7\u500d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u53ca1/16\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5982CSR\u7b49\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cIKE\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9694\u79bb\u6838\u5d4c\u5165\uff08IKE\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6781\u5927\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

These tools have lowered the cost of code generation, explanation, and testing, while introducing new forms of automation into routine development tasks. In contrast, most of the software engineering and computer engineering curricula remain closely aligned with pedagogical models that equate manual syntax production with technical competence. This growing misalignment raises concerns regarding assessment validity, learning outcomes, and the development of foundational skills. Adopting a conceptual research approach, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing how generative AI alters core software engineering competencies and introduces a pedagogical design model for LLM-integrated education. Attention is given to computer engineering programs in Turkey, where centralized regulation, large class sizes, and exam-oriented assessment practices amplify these challenges. The framework delineates how problem analysis, design, implementation, and testing increasingly shift from construction toward critique, validation, and human-AI stewardship. In addition, the paper argues that traditional plagiarism-centric integrity mechanisms are becoming insufficient, motivating a transition toward a process transparency model. While this work provides a structured proposal for curriculum adaptation, it remains a theoretical contribution; the paper concludes by outlining the need for longitudinal empirical studies to evaluate these interventions and their long-term impacts on learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ChatGPT\u548cGitHub Copilot\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4ece\u6784\u5efa\u8f6c\u5411\u6279\u5224\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u8f6c\u53d8\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6284\u88ad\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bda\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u81f3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u65e5\u5e38\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u7d27\u5bc6\u9075\u5faa\u5c06\u624b\u52a8\u8bed\u6cd5\u751f\u4ea7\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u679c\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6280\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6838\u5fc3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u6574\u5408\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4e86\u571f\u8033\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76d1\u7ba1\u3001\u5927\u73ed\u6388\u8bfe\u548c\u8003\u8bd5\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u800c\u52a0\u5267\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u4ece\u6784\u5efa\u8f6c\u5411\u6279\u5224\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u5171\u7ba1\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ee5\u6284\u88ad\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bda\u4fe1\u673a\u5236\u6b63\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u6587\u7ae0\u6700\u540e\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb5\u5411\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Instead of representing text or video as sequences of discrete tokens processed by attention, SGFMs treat generation as the evolution of a continuous field governed by constrained stochastic dynamics in a multiscale wavelet basis. This formulation replaces global attention with local operators, spectral projections, and Navier--Stokes-like transport, yielding a generative mechanism grounded in continuity, geometry, and physical structure.\n  Our framework provides three key innovations: (i) a field-theoretic ontology in which text and video are unified as trajectories of a stochastic partial differential equation; (ii) a wavelet-domain representation that induces sparsity, scale separation, and computational efficiency; and (iii) a constrained stochastic flow that enforces stability, coherence, and uncertainty propagation. Together, these components define a generative architecture that departs fundamentally from autoregressive modeling and diffusion-based approaches.

Lopes"], "title": "Bridging the Gap: Empowering Small Models in Reliable OpenACC-based Parallelization via GEPA-Optimized Prompting", "comment": null, "summary": "OpenACC lowers the barrier to GPU offloading, but writing high-performing pragma remains complex, requiring deep domain expertise in memory hierarchies, data movement, and parallelization strategies. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising potential solution for automated parallel code generation, but naive prompting often results in syntactically incorrect directives, uncompilable code, or performance that fails to exceed CPU baselines. We present a systematic prompt optimization approach to enhance OpenACC pragma generation without the prohibitive computational costs associated with model post-training. Leveraging the GEPA (GEnetic-PAreto) framework, we iteratively evolve prompts through a reflective feedback loop. This process utilizes crossover and mutation of instructions, guided by expert-curated gold examples and structured feedback based on clause- and clause parameter-level mismatches between the gold and predicted pragma. In our evaluation on the PolyBench suite, we observe an increase in compilation success rates for programs annotated with OpenACC pragma generated using the optimized prompts compared to those annotated using the simpler initial prompt, particularly for the \"nano\"-scale models. Specifically, with optimized prompts, the compilation success rate for GPT-4.1 Nano surged from 66.7% to 93.3%, and for GPT-5 Nano improved from 86.7% to 100%, matching or surpassing the capabilities of their significantly larger, more expensive versions. Beyond compilation, the optimized prompts resulted in a 21% increase in the number of programs that achieve functional GPU speedups over CPU baselines. These results demonstrate that prompt optimization effectively unlocks the potential of smaller, cheaper LLMs in writing stable and effective GPU-offloading directives, establishing a cost-effective pathway to automated directive-based parallelization in HPC workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9057\u4f20-\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\uff08GEPA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8fed\u4ee3\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8OpenACC\u6307\u4ee4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7531\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fnano\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86GPU\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eCPU\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1OpenACC\u7b80\u5316\u4e86GPU\u5378\u8f7d\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f16\u5199\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684pragma\u4ecd\u7136\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u539a\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5f80\u5f80\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684OpenACC pragma\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9057\u4f20-\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\uff08GEPA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6307\u4ee4\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u9ec4\u91d1\u793a\u4f8b\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u53e5\u548c\u5b50\u53e5\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5728PolyBench\u5957\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8enano\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5982GPT-4.1 Nano\u548cGPT-5 Nano\uff0c\u5176\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4ece66.7%\u5347\u81f393.3%\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece86.7%\u8fbe\u5230100%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fd8\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b9e\u73b0\u529f\u80fd\u6027GPU\u52a0\u901f\u8d85\u8fc7CPU\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4e8621%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u91ca\u653e\u5c0f\u578b\u5ec9\u4ef7LLM\u5728\u7f16\u5199\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684GPU\u5378\u8f7d\u6307\u4ee4\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3aHPC\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Bridging Sparse and Dense Models", "comment": "25 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "Collaborative Filtering (CF) remains the cornerstone of modern recommender systems, with dense embedding--based methods dominating current practice. However, these approaches suffer from a critical limitation: our theoretical analysis reveals a fundamental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ceiling when modeling unpopular items, where parameter-based dense models experience diminishing SNR under severe data sparsity. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SaD (Sparse and Dense), a unified framework that integrates the semantic expressiveness of dense embeddings with the structural reliability of sparse interaction patterns. We theoretically show that aligning these dual views yields a strictly superior global SNR. Concretely, SaD introduces a lightweight bidirectional alignment mechanism: the dense view enriches the sparse view by injecting semantic correlations, while the sparse view regularizes the dense model through explicit structural signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under this dual-view alignment, even a simple matrix factorization--style dense model can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, SaD is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of existing recommender models, highlighting the enduring power of collaborative filtering when leveraged from dual perspectives. Further evaluations on real-world benchmarks show that SaD consistently outperforms strong baselines, ranking first on the BarsMatch leaderboard.

A comprehensive feature set is engineered, including lagged log-returns (up to 30 days) and established technical indicators such as short- and medium-term rolling volatility measures and the 14-period Relative Strength Index. Hyperparameter optimization is performed using Optuna with time-series cross-validation on the initial training segment. Out-of-sample performance is rigorously assessed via walk-forward validation under both expanding and fixed-length rolling window schemes across multiple lag configurations, simulating real-world deployment and avoiding lookahead bias. Predictive accuracy is evaluated using root mean squared error, mean absolute error, coefficient of determination (R-squared), and directional accuracy on both log-returns and reconstructed closing prices. Empirical results show that the optimal configuration, an expanding window with 20 lags, outperforms tuned ARIMA and Ridge regression benchmarks, achieving the lowest log-return RMSE (0.013450) and MAE (0.009814) alongside a directional accuracy of 65.15%.

While large language models (LLMs) can now provide exceptional capabilities that model user behavior for sequential recommendation tasks, their substantial memory footprint and computational overhead make the deployment on resource-constrained devices a high risk proposition. In this paper, we propose OD-LLM, the first task-adaptive compression framework explicitly designed to provide efficient and accurate on-device deployment of LLMs for sequential recommendation tasks. OD-LLM uniquely integrates two complementary compression strategies: a low-rank structural compression algorithm which uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to significantly reduce parameter redundancy in the model, and a novel tokenization normalization technique that better complements the low-rank decomposition process being used. Additionally, to minimize any potential performance degradation when using higher compression ratios, a novel progressive alignment algorithm is used to iteratively refine the parameters required layerwise in the target model. Empirical evaluations conducted on sequential recommendation benchmarks show that OD-LLM exhibits no loss in effectiveness when compared to the original recommendation model, when the deployed model size is halved. These promising results demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of OD-LLM, making this novel solution a practical alternative for real-time, on-device solutions wishing to replace expensive, remotely executed LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OD-LLM\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u534a\u65f6\uff0cOD-LLM\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u8350\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5728\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6709\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u91cf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "OD-LLM\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3(SVD)\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f85\u52a9\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6807\u8bb0\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7387\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5c42\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5c06\u90e8\u7f72\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u534a\uff0cOD-LLM\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86OD-LLM\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "OD-LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bfb\u6c42\u66ff\u4ee3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u9700\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Promotions shift, consumer preferences evolve, and supply disruptions alter demand patterns, causing what is known as concept drift. This silent degradation leads to stockouts or excess inventory without triggering any system warnings. Current industry practice relies on manual monitoring and scheduled retraining every 3-6 months, which wastes computational resources during stable periods while missing rapid drift events. Existing academic methods focus narrowly on drift detection without addressing diagnosis or remediation, and they ignore the hierarchical structure inherent in supply chain data. What retailers need is an end-to-end system that detects drift early, explains its root causes, and automatically corrects affected models. We propose DriftGuard, a five-module framework that addresses the complete drift lifecycle. The system combines an ensemble of four complementary detection methods, namely error-based monitoring, statistical tests, autoencoder anomaly detection, and Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) change-point analysis, with hierarchical propagation analysis to identify exactly where drift occurs across product lines. Once detected, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis diagnoses the root causes, and a cost-aware retraining strategy selectively updates only the most affected models.

Submitted to ICML 2026", "summary": "Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) suffers from slow convergence under tight privacy budgets due to the overwhelming noise introduced to preserve privacy. While adaptive optimizers can accelerate convergence, existing second-order methods such as DP-FedNew require O(d^2) memory at each client to maintain local feature covariance matrices, making them impractical for high-dimensional models. We propose DP-FedSOFIM, a server-side second-order optimization framework that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) as a natural gradient preconditioner while requiring only O(d) memory per client. By employing the Sherman-Morrison formula for efficient matrix inversion, DP-FedSOFIM achieves O(d) computational complexity per round while maintaining the convergence benefits of second-order methods. Our analysis proves that the server-side preconditioning preserves (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy through the post-processing theorem.

However, their widespread use remains constrained by long sampling trajectories, stochastic variance in the reverse process, and limited structural awareness in denoising dynamics. The Directly Denoising Diffusion Model (DDDM) mitigates these inefficiencies by replacing stochastic reverse MCMC updates with deterministic denoising step, substantially reducing inference time. Yet, the theoretical underpinnings of such deterministic updates have remained opaque. In this work, we provide a principled reinterpretation of DDDM through the lens of the Reverse Transition Kernel (RTK) framework by Huang et al. 2024, unifying deterministic and stochastic diffusion under a shared probabilistic formalism. By expressing the DDDM reverse process as an approximate kernel operator, we show that the direct denoising process implicitly optimizes a structured transport map between noisy and clean samples. This perspective elucidates why deterministic denoising achieves efficient inference. Beyond theoretical clarity, this reframing resolves several long-standing bottlenecks in molecular diffusion. The RTK view ensures numerical stability by enforcing well-conditioned reverse kernels, improves sample consistency by eliminating stochastic variance, and enables scalable and symmetry-preserving denoisers that respect SE(3) equivariance. Empirically, we demonstrate that RTK-guided deterministic denoising achieves faster convergence and higher structural fidelity than stochastic diffusion models, while preserving chemical validity across GEOM-DRUGS dataset.

Although federal courts follow the 1976 Copyright Act, their interpretations and factor weightings vary widely across jurisdictions. This inconsistency creates unpredictability for litigants and obscures the empirical basis of legal decisions. This research introduces a novel discourse-based Large Language Model (LLM) methodology that integrates Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) with an agentic workflow to extract and quantify previously opaque reasoning patterns from judicial opinions. Our framework addresses a major gap in empirical legal scholarship by parsing opinions into hierarchical discourse structures and using a three-stage pipeline, i.e., Dataset Construction, Discourse Analysis, and Agentic Feature Extraction. This pipeline identifies reasoning components and extract feature labels with corresponding discourse subtrees. In analyzing copyright damage rulings, we show that discourse-augmented LLM analysis outperforms traditional methods while uncovering unquantified variations in factor weighting across circuits. These findings offer both methodological advances in computational legal analysis and practical insights into judicial reasoning, with implications for legal practitioners seeking predictive tools, scholars studying legal principle application, and policymakers confronting inconsistencies in copyright law.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4fee\u8f9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u80fd\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u53f8\u6cd5\u610f\u89c1\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5148\u524d\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u5206\u6790\u548c\u80fd\u5e26\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5e94\u8bdd\u8bed\u5b50\u6811\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u5728\u5206\u6790\u7248\u6743\u635f\u5bb3\u88c1\u51b3\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u8bdd\u8bed\u7684LLM\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5de1\u56de\u6cd5\u9662\u4e4b\u95f4\u56e0\u7d20\u6743\u91cd\u672a\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u6cd5\u9662\u5728\u7248\u6743\u635f\u5bb3\u8d54\u507f\u5224\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u56e0\u7d20\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bc9\u8bbc\u5f53\u4e8b\u4eba\u9762\u4e34\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u6cd5\u5f8b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u578b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u4fee\u8f9e\u7ed3\u6784\u7406\u8bba(RST)\u4e0e\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u53f8\u6cd5\u610f\u89c1\u4e66\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e4b\u524d\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u6b65\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bdd\u8bed\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u80fd\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6790\u7248\u6743\u635f\u5bb3\u88c1\u51b3\u65f6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u8bdd\u8bedLLM\u5206\u6790\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5de1\u56de\u6cd5\u5ead\u95f4\u56e0\u5b50\u6743\u91cd\u4e0a\u672a\u66fe\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u53d8\u52a8\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u53f8\u6cd5\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5bf9\u5bfb\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u6cd5\u5f8b\u539f\u5219\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u8005\u4ee5\u53ca\u9762\u5bf9\u7248\u6743\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u90fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6784\u5efa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u4e2d\u6bd2\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aForeman\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u8b66\u544a\u5982XZ Utils\u653b\u51fb\u4e2d\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u4ee5\u9632\u8303\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6bd2\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u5f3a\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u6613\u7ed5\u8fc7\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u9274\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4fdd\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6743\u9650\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u52a0\u5f3a\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6297\u6f5c\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aForeman\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u63d0\u9192\u5173\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "Foreman\u5de5\u5177\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8b66\u544a\u4e86XZ Utils\u653b\u51fb\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u67e5\u5f00\u53d1\u9636\u6bb5\u9694\u79bb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9632\u62a4\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65bd\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u5c55\u671b\u672a\u6765\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u80fd\u50cf\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee3\u7801\u68c0\u67e5\u5668\u4e00\u6837\u666e\u53ca\u3002"}}

We propose a novel fairness model that ensures group fairness at a finer granularity level (referred to as block) within each sliding window. This formulation is particularly useful when the window size is large, making it desirable to enforce fairness at a finer granularity. Within this framework, we address two key challenges: efficiently monitoring whether each sliding window satisfies block-level group fairness, and reordering the current window as effectively as possible when fairness is violated. To enable real-time monitoring, we design sketch-based data structures that maintain attribute distributions with minimal overhead. We also develop optimal, efficient algorithms for the reordering task, supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation on four real-world streaming scenarios demonstrates the practical effectiveness of our approach.

Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as \"diversity\" or \"debiasing\", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias.

They produce inconsistent results when executed multiple times on the same code, invalidating the assumption that a test failure indicates a software defect. Recent work on LLM-based test generation has identified flakiness as a potential problem with generated tests. However, its prevalence and underlying causes are unclear. We examined the flakiness of LLM-generated tests in the context of four relational database management systems: SAP HANA, DuckDB, MySQL, and SQLite. We amplified test suites with two LLMs, GPT-4o and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, to assess the flakiness of the generated test cases. Our results suggest that generated tests have a slightly higher proportion of flaky tests compared to existing tests. Based on a manual inspection, we found that the most common root cause of flakiness was the reliance of a test on a certain order that is not guaranteed (\"unordered collection\"), which was present in 72 of 115 flaky tests (63%). Furthermore, both LLMs transferred the flakiness from the existing tests to the newly generated tests via the provided prompt context. Our experiments suggest that flakiness transfer is more prevalent in closed-source systems such as SAP HANA than in open-source systems. Our study informs developers on what types of flakiness to expect from LLM-generated tests.

Their complementary roles motivate a unified modeling paradigm. Early studies to unify S&R adopt shared encoders with task-specific heads, while recent efforts reframe item ranking in both S&R as conditional generation. The latter holds particular promise, enabling end-to-end optimization and leveraging the semantic understanding of LLMs. However, existing methods rely on full fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and limits scalability. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) offers a more practical alternative but faces two critical challenges in unifying S&R: (1) gradient conflicts across tasks due to divergent optimization objectives, and (2) shifts in user intent understanding caused by overfitting to fine-tuning data, which distort general-domain knowledge and weaken LLM reasoning. To address the above issues, we propose Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS), a novel framework that unifies S&R with LLMs while alleviating gradient conflicts and preserving general-domain knowledge. GEMS introduces (1) \\textbf{Multi-Subspace Decomposition}, which disentangles shared and task-specific optimization signals into complementary low-rank subspaces, thereby reducing destructive gradient interference, and (2) \\textbf{Null-Space Projection}, which constrains parameter updates to a subspace orthogonal to the general-domain knowledge space, mitigating shifts in user intent understanding. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that GEMS consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across both search and recommendation tasks, achieving superior effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGEMS\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u6765\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eGEMS\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u663e\u5f0f\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u4ece\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u9690\u542b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u52a0\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5934\u90e8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5b8c\u5168\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u8fd8\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03(PEFT)\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Gradient Multi-Subspace Tuning (GEMS)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528LLMs\uff08\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u4fdd\u5b58\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002GEMS\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1. **\u591a\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u89e3**\uff0c\u5c06\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5206\u79bb\u5230\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u51cf\u5c11\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff1b2. **\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71**\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u81f3\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGEMS\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u4e24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u90fd\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GEMS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u5b9e\u73b0\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u5b83\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

SafePlanner targets two core challenges: generating structurally meaningful test scenarios and detecting hazardous planning behaviors. To maximize coverage, SafePlanner performs a structural analysis of the Plan model implementation - specifically, its scene-transition logic and hierarchical control flow - and uses this insight to extract feasible scene transitions from code. It then composes test scenarios by combining these transitions with non-player vehicle (NPC) behaviors. Guided fuzzing is applied to explore the behavioral space of the Plan model under these scenarios. We evaluate SafePlanner on Baidu Apollo, a production-grade level 4 ADS.

Modern space weather monitoring generates massive volumes of high-frequency, multivariate time series (MVTS) data from sources such as the Geostationary perational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Machine learning (ML) models trained on this data show strong predictive power, but most existing methods overlook domain-specific feasibility constraints. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a key tool for improving model interpretability, yet existing approaches rarely enforce physical plausibility. This work introduces a Physics-Guided Counterfactual Explanation framework, a novel method for generating counterfactual explanations in time series classification tasks that remain consistent with underlying physical principles. Applied to solar energetic particles (SEP) forecasting, this framework achieves over 80% reduction in Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance increasing the proximity, produces counterfactual explanations with higher sparsity, and reduces runtime by nearly 50% compared to state-of-the-art baselines such as DiCE. Beyond numerical improvements, this framework ensures that generated counterfactual explanations are physically plausible and actionable in scientific domains.

We introduce TEMPO, the first benchmark combining temporal reasoning with reasoning-intensive retrieval across 13 domains. TEMPO features: (1) 1,730 complex queries requiring deep temporal reasoning such as tracking changes, identifying trends, or comparing cross-period evidence; (2) step-wise retrieval planning with 3,976 decomposed steps and gold documents mapped to each step for multi-hop evaluation; and (3) novel temporal metrics including Temporal Coverage@k and Temporal Precision@k measuring whether results span required time periods. Evaluation of 12 retrieval systems reveals substantial challenges: the best model (DiVeR) achieves only 32.0 NDCG@10 and 71.4\\% Temporal Coverage@10, demonstrating difficulty in retrieving temporally complete evidence.

It remains an open question whether the remarkable performance of WSD - using a decaying learning rate for only a fraction of training compared to cosine decay - is a phenomenon specific to transformer-based language models that can potentially offer new theoretical insights into their training dynamics. Inspired by the usage of learning rate schedulers as a new lens into understanding landscape geometry (e.g., river valley, connected minima, progressive sharpening), in this work we compare the WSD path of the Adam optimizer on a Pythia-like language model to that of a small CNN trained to classify CIFAR10 images. We observe most training signals, optimizer path features, and sharpness dynamics to be qualitatively similar in such architectures. This consistency points to shared geometric characteristics of the loss landscapes of old and new nonconvex problems, and hints to future research questions around the geometry of high dimensional optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86Warmup Stable Decay (WSD)\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e7\u7684\u548c\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8Warmup Stable Decay (WSD)\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u662f\u5426\u4ec5\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8fd8\u662f\u4e5f\u80fd\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982CNN\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4f7f\u7528WSD\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u5728\u7c7b\u4f3cPythia\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u578bCNN\uff08\u7528\u4e8eCIFAR10\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5728\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8def\u5f84\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53ca\u9510\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fd8\u662f\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u5171\u540c\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u56f4\u7ed5\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, existing spatiotemporal retrieval methods are often extensions of conventional vector search systems that rely on external filters or specialized indices to incorporate temporal and spatial constraints, leading to inefficiency, architectural complexity, and limited flexibility in handling heterogeneous modalities. To overcome these challenges, we present a unified spatiotemporal vector retrieval framework that integrates temporal, spatial, and semantic cues within a coherent similarity space while maintaining scalability and adaptability to continuous data streams. Specifically, we propose (1) a Rotary-based Unified Encoding Method that embeds time and location into rotational position vectors for consistent spatiotemporal representation; (2) a Circular Incremental Update Mechanism that supports efficient sliding-window updates without global re-encoding or index reconstruction; and (3) a Weighted Interest-based Retrieval Algorithm that adaptively balances modality weights for context-aware and personalized retrieval. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while maintaining robustness under dynamic data evolution.

However, when these libraries introduce defects, ranging from silent computation errors to subtle performance regressions, it is often challenging for downstream users to assess whether their own programs are affected. Such impact analysis requires not only understanding the defect semantics but also checking whether the client code satisfies complex triggering conditions involving configuration flags, runtime environments, and indirect API usage. We present DepRadar, an agent coordination framework for fine grained defect and impact analysis in DL library updates. DepRadar coordinates four specialized agents across three steps: 1. the PR Miner and Code Diff Analyzer extract structured defect semantics from commits or pull requests, 2. the Orchestrator Agent synthesizes these signals into a unified defect pattern with trigger conditions, and 3. the Impact Analyzer checks downstream programs to determine whether the defect can be triggered. To improve accuracy and explainability, DepRadar integrates static analysis with DL-specific domain rules for defect reasoning and client side tracing. We evaluate DepRadar on 157 PRs and 70 commits across two representative DL libraries.

However, the dynamic nature of real-world data, broadly termed \\textit{data shift}, renders TDL models prone to rapid performance degradation, requiring costly relabeling and inefficient retraining. Meta-learning, which enables models to adapt quickly to new data with few examples, offers a promising alternative for mitigating these challenges. Here, we systematically compare TDL with fine-tuning and optimization-based meta-learning algorithms to assess their ability to address data shift in time-series classification. We introduce a controlled, task-oriented seismic benchmark (SeisTask) and show that meta-learning typically achieves faster and more stable adaptation with reduced overfitting in data-scarce regimes and smaller model architectures. As data availability and model capacity increase, its advantages diminish, with TDL with fine-tuning performing comparably. Finally, we examine how task diversity influences meta-learning and find that alignment between training and test distributions, rather than diversity alone, drives performance gains. Overall, this work provides a systematic evaluation of when and why meta-learning outperforms TDL under data shift and contributes SeisTask as a benchmark for advancing adaptive learning research in time-series domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TDL\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SeisTask\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0cTDL\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u53ef\u4e0e\u4e4b\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u63a8\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9047\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u5c11\u91cf\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5730\u9707\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6(SeisTask)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u8f83\u5c11\u6216\u6a21\u578b\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u4f46\u5f53\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4f55\u65f6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SeisTask\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

The scale of this data and its unstructured format still continue to grow requiring ever more robust automated extraction and retrieval mechanisms. Existing work, leveraging the web pages Document Object Model (DOM), often derives clustering vectors from coordinates informed by the DOM such as visual placement or tree structure. The construction and component value of these vectors often go unexamined. Our work proposes and examines DOM coordinates in a detail to understand their impact on web page segmentation. Our work finds that there is no one-size-fits-all vector, and that visual coordinates under-perform compared to DOM coordinates by about 20-30% on average. This challenges the necessity of including visual coordinates in clustering vectors. Further, our work finds that simple vectors, comprised of single coordinates, fare better than complex vectors constituting 68.2% of the top performing vectors of the pages examined. Finally, we find that if a vector, clustering algorithm, and page are properly matched, one can achieve overall high segmentation accuracy at 74%. This constitutes a 20% improvement over a naive application of vectors. Conclusively, our results challenge the current orthodoxy for segmentation vector creation, opens up the possibility to optimize page segmentation via clustering on DOM coordinates, and highlights the importance of finding mechanisms to match the best approach for web page segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86DOM\u5750\u6807\u5728\u7f51\u9875\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u9002\u5408\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u5750\u6807\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982DOM\u5750\u6807\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6bd4\u590d\u6742\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u786e\u5339\u914d\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9875\u9762\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u7f51\u9875\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9d\u8d35\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u683c\u5f0f\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u4eceDOM\uff08\u6587\u6863\u5bf9\u8c61\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5750\u6807\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u805a\u7c7b\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6784\u6210\u53ca\u5176\u4ef7\u503c\u5f80\u5f80\u672a\u88ab\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86DOM\u5750\u6807\u5bf9\u7f51\u9875\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5750\u6807\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u5750\u6807\u4e0eDOM\u5750\u6807\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6070\u5f53\u5339\u914d\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u9875\u9762\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u5272\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u5750\u6807\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4DOM\u5750\u6807\u4f4e20-30%\uff1b\u7b80\u5355\u5411\u91cf\u6bd4\u590d\u6742\u5411\u91cf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5360\u636e\u4e86\u6240\u5206\u6790\u9875\u9762\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u768468.2%\uff1b\u5f53\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u9875\u9762\u5f97\u5230\u9002\u5f53\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53ef\u8fbe74%\uff0c\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8620%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u8bba\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u5411\u91cf\u521b\u5efa\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eDOM\u5750\u6807\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u9875\u9762\u5206\u5272\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f51\u9875\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce MM-BRIGHT, the first multimodal benchmark for reasoning-intensive retrieval. Our dataset consists of 2,803 real-world queries spanning 29 diverse technical domains, with four tasks of increasing complexity: text-to-text, multimodal-to-text, multimodal-to-image, and multimodal-to-multimodal retrieval. Extensive evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art models struggle across all tasks: BM25 achieves only 8.5 nDCG@10 on text-only retrieval, while the best multimodal model Nomic-Vision reaches just 27.6 nDCG@10 on multimodal-to-text retrieval actually underperforming the best text-only model (DiVeR: 32.2). These results highlight substantial headroom and position MM-BRIGHT as a testbed for next-generation retrieval models that better integrate visual reasoning.

Building on Nextflow, the nf-core community curates standardized, peer-reviewed pipelines that follow strict testing, documentation, and governance guidelines. Despite its broad adoption, little is known about the challenges users face during the development and maintenance of these pipelines. This paper presents an empirical study of 25,173 issues and pull requests from these pipelines to uncover recurring challenges, management practices, and perceived difficulties. Using BERTopic modeling, we identify 13 key challenges, including pipeline development and integration, bug fixing, integrating genomic data, managing CI configurations, and handling version updates. We then examine issue resolution dynamics, showing that 89.38\\% of issues and pull requests are eventually closed, with half resolved within three days. Statistical analysis reveals that the presence of labels (large effect, $\u03b4$ = 0.94) and code snippets (medium effect, $\u03b4$ = 0.50) significantly improve resolution likelihood. Further analysis reveals that tool development and repository maintenance poses the most significant challenges, followed by testing pipelines and CI configurations, and debugging containerized pipelines. Overall, this study provides actionable insights into the collaborative development and maintenance of nf-core pipelines, highlighting opportunities to enhance their usability, sustainability, and reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679025,173\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4nf-core\u6d41\u7a0b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86BERTopic\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa13\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa89.38%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff08\u5927\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u03b4=0.94\uff09\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff08\u4e2d\u7b49\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u03b4=0.50\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Nextflow\u53ca\u5176\u793e\u533anf-core\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6311\u6218\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3001\u7ba1\u7406\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u5230\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u5173\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6765\u81eanf-core\u9879\u76ee\u768425,173\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86BERTopic\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8613\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fee\u590d\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u3001CI\u914d\u7f6e\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u7248\u672c\u66f4\u65b0\u7b49\u3002\u7ea689.38%\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8bf7\u6c42\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u7ec8\u5173\u95ed\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u534a\u5728\u4e09\u5929\u5185\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ef4\u62a4\u662f\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0eCI\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8c03\u8bd5\u5bb9\u5668\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3nf-core\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u7ef4\u62a4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

For a general class of stochastic environments, we provide the first algorithm SCaLE that provably achieves a distribution-agnostic sub-linear dynamic regret, without the knowledge of hitting cost structure. En-route, we present a novel spectral regret analysis that separately quantifies eigenvalue-error driven regret and eigenbasis-perturbation driven regret. Extensive numerical experiments, against online-learning baselines, corroborate our claims, and highlight statistical consistency of our algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u65e0\u754c\u5ea6\u91cf\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5SCaLE\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u65e0\u754c\u5ea6\u91cf\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u4e8c\u6b21\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684L2\u8303\u6570\u5207\u6362\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSCaLE\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8c31\u540e\u6094\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u6270\u52a8\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9057\u61be\u3002", "result": "SCaLE\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5148\u77e5\u9053\u547d\u4e2d\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u79fb\u52a8\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent work has reduced the number of training steps required to reach peak performance, the overall wall-clock training time often remains unchanged or even increases due to higher per-step cost. We propose MMR-GRPO, which integrates Maximal Marginal Relevance to reweigh rewards based on completion diversity. Our key insight is that semantically redundant completions contribute limited marginal learning signal; prioritizing diverse solutions yields more informative updates and accelerates convergence. Extensive evaluations across three model sizes (1.5B, 7B, 8B), three GRPO variants, and five mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that MMR-GRPO achieves comparable peak performance while requiring on average 47.9% fewer training steps and 70.2% less wall-clock time.

The core challenges lie in accurately imputing missing views without introducing bias, while maintaining semantic consistency across views and compactness within clusters. To address these challenges, we propose DIMVC-HIA, a novel deep IMVC framework that integrates hierarchical imputation and alignment with four key components: (1) view-specific autoencoders for latent feature extraction, coupled with a view-shared clustering predictor to produce soft cluster assignments; (2) a hierarchical imputation module that first estimates missing cluster assignments based on cross-view contrastive similarity, and then reconstructs missing features using intra-view, intra-cluster statistics; (3) an energy-based semantic alignment module, which promotes intra-cluster compactness by minimizing energy variance around low-energy cluster anchors; and (4) a contrastive assignment alignment module, which enhances cross-view consistency and encourages confident, well-separated cluster predictions. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves superior performance under varying levels of missingness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6DIMVC-HIA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u63d2\u8865\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u51c6\u786e\u63d2\u8865\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7c07\u5185\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\uff08IMVC\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u672a\u5b8c\u5168\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u586b\u8865\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u56fe\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7c07\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DIMVC-HIA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u89c6\u56fe\u7279\u5b9a\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\u5171\u4eab\u805a\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\uff1b2) \u5c42\u6b21\u63d2\u8865\u6a21\u5757\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u3001\u7c07\u5185\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cd\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u7c07\u951a\u70b9\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7c07\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff1b4) \u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u914d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u5206\u79bb\u826f\u597d\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "DIMVC-HIA\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u6027\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u63d2\u8865\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u5904\u7406\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7c07\u5185\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the standalone use of LLMs without post-processing has proven insufficient, often producing tests that fail to compile or achieve high coverage. Several techniques have been proposed to address these issues, reporting improvements in test compilation and coverage. While important, LLM-based test generation techniques have been evaluated against relatively weak baselines (for todays' standards), i.e., old LLM versions and relatively weak prompts, which may exacerbate the performance contribution of the approaches. In other words, stronger (newer) LLMs may obviate any advantage these techniques bring. We investigate this issue by replicating four state-of-the-art LLM-based test generation tools, HITS, SymPrompt, TestSpark, and CoverUp that include engineering components aimed at guiding the test generation process through compilation and execution feedback, and evaluate their relative effectiveness and efficiency over a plain LLM test generation method. We integrate current LLM versions in all approaches and run an experiment on 393 classes and 3,657 methods. Our results show that the plain LLM approach can outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches in all test effectiveness metrics we used: line coverage (by 17.72%), branch coverage (by 19.80%) and mutation score (by 20.92%), and it does so at a comparable cost (LLM queries). We also observe that the granularity at which the plain LLM is applied has a significant impact on the cost. We therefore propose targeting first the program classes, where test generation is more efficient, and then the uncovered methods to reduce the number of LLM requests. This strategy achieves comparable (slightly higher) effectiveness while requiring about 20% fewer LLM requests.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7c7b\u518d\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11LLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u751a\u81f3\u7a0d\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea620%\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e5f\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u591a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u800c\u4e0d\u7ecf\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u7f16\u8bd1\u6216\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u8bd5\u56fe\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u6210\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5938\u5927\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f53\u524d\u66f4\u5f3a\u7248\u672cLLM\u4e0b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u9009\u53d6HITS\u3001SymPrompt\u3001TestSpark\u548cCoverUp\u56db\u79cd\u5305\u542b\u5de5\u7a0b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6700\u65b0\u7684LLM\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5728393\u4e2a\u7c7b\u548c3,657\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6539\u53d8LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6210\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387(\u9ad8\u51fa17.72%)\u3001\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387(\u9ad8\u51fa19.80%)\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570(\u9ad8\u51fa20.92%)\u7b49\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6210\u672c\uff08LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u6b21\u6570\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u5148\u9488\u5bf9\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7c7b\u7136\u540e\u9488\u5bf9\u672a\u8986\u76d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea620%\u7684LLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684LLM\u65f6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574LLM\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This inconsistency undermines trust in high-stakes applications where we want consistent predictions. We propose three approaches to reduce inconsistency among predictions for the members of the Rashomon set. The first approach is \\textbf{outlier correction}. An outlier has a label that none of the good models are capable of predicting correctly. Outliers can cause the Rashomon set to have high variance predictions in a local area, so fixing them can lower variance. Our second approach is local patching. In a local region around a test point, models may disagree with each other because some of them are biased. We can detect and fix such biases using a validation set, which also reduces multiplicity. Our third approach is pairwise reconciliation, where we find pairs of models that disagree on a region around the test point. We modify predictions that disagree, making them less biased.

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aShortCoder\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cShortCoder\u5728HumanEval\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8618.1%-37.8%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u5230\u67d0\u4e9b\u56fa\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5982\u6bcf\u6b21\u751f\u6210token\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aShortCoder\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1)\u9488\u5bf9Python\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u5341\u4e2a\u8bed\u6cd5\u7ea7\u7b80\u5316\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c4\u5219\u57fa\u4e8eAST\u4fdd\u6301\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b018.1%\u7684token\u51cf\u5c11\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u529f\u80fd\uff1b(2)\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u91cd\u5199\u548cLLM\u6307\u5bfc\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u7248\u672c\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6ShorterCodeBench\uff1b(3)\u5411\u57fa\u7840LLMs\u6ce8\u5165\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cShortCoder\u5728HumanEval\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e8618.1%-37.8%\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u6846\u67b6ShortCoder\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

SRT exploits the empirical similarity of rollouts for the same prompt across training steps by storing previously generated continuations in a per-prompt tree-structured cache. During generation, the current policy uses this tree as the draft model for performing speculative decoding. To keep the cache fresh and improve draft model quality, SRT updates trees online from ongoing rollouts and proactively performs run-ahead generation during idle GPU bubbles. Integrated into standard RL pipelines (\\textit{e.g.}, PPO, GRPO and DAPO) and multi-turn settings, SRT consistently reduces generation and step latency and lowers per-token inference cost, achieving up to 2.08x wall-clock time speedup during rollout.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSRT\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe2.08\u500d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u5206\u5e03\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u7f13\u5b58\uff08SRT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u5b58\u50a8\u4e4b\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5ef6\u7eed\u5185\u5bb9\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6811\u5f62\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u6839\u636e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8349\u7a3f\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSRT\u8fd8\u4f1a\u5728\u7ebf\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6811\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b0\u9c9c\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GPU\u7a7a\u95f2\u65f6\u4e3b\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u524d\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "SRT\u53ef\u4ee5\u6301\u7eed\u51cf\u5c11\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u5c55\u5f00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe2.08\u500d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u65f6\u95f4\u63d0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "SRT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5e03\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

It achieves SOTA performance among open-source models of comparable scale across challenging benchmarks in mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation -- even outperforming several larger models. We begin by critically reexamining a widely adopted distillation paradigm in the community: SFT on teacher-generated responses, also known as sequence-level distillation. Although a series of recent works following this scheme have demonstrated remarkable efficiency and strong empirical performance, they are primarily grounded in the SFT perspective. Consequently, these approaches focus predominantly on designing heuristic rules for SFT data filtering, while largely overlooking the core principle of distillation itself -- enabling the student model to learn the teacher's full output distribution so as to inherit its generalization capability. Specifically, we identify three critical limitations in current practice: i) Inadequate representation of the teacher's sequence-level distribution; ii) Misalignment between the teacher's output distribution and the student's learning capacity; and iii) Exposure bias arising from teacher-forced training versus autoregressive inference. In summary, these shortcomings reflect a systemic absence of explicit teacher-student interaction throughout the distillation process, leaving the essence of distillation underexploited. To address these issues, we propose several methodological innovations that collectively form an enhanced sequence-level distillation training pipeline. Remarkably, DASD-4B-Thinking obtains competitive results using only 448K training samples -- an order of magnitude fewer than those employed by most existing open-source efforts. To support community research, we publicly release our models and the training dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578bDASD-4B-Thinking\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u540c\u7c7b\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u5185\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u505a\u6cd5\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86448K\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5f53\u524d\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531\u6559\u5e08\u5f3a\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u4e92\u52a8\u800c\u9020\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u5584\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u6559\u5e08\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "DASD-4B-Thinking\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u4ec5\u7528\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\uff0844.8\u4e07\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8fbe\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u6210\u5c31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u5185\u7684\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, the combination of lengthy reasoning traces with multiple sampling introduces substantial computation and high end-to-end latency. Prior work on accelerating this process has relied on similarity-based or confidence-based pruning, but these signals do not reliably indicate trace quality. To address these limitations, we propose STEP: Step-level Trace Evaluation and Pruning, a novel pruning framework that evaluates reasoning steps using hidden states and dynamically prunes unpromising traces during generation. We train a lightweight step scorer to estimate trace quality, and design a GPU memory-aware pruning strategy that triggers pruning as the GPU memory is saturated by KV cache to reduce end-to-end latency. Experiments across challenging reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that STEP reduces end-to-end inference latency by 45%-70% on average compared to self-consistency while also improving reasoning accuracy.

Notably, certain cardiac conditions that are infrequently encountered are disproportionately underrepresented in these datasets. Although algorithmic generation and oversampling of specific ECG signal types can mitigate class skew, there is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of such techniques in ECG classification. Furthermore, the methodologies and scenarios of ECG acquisition introduce noise, further complicating the processing of ECG data. This paper presents a significantly enhanced ECG classifier that simultaneously addresses both class imbalance and noise-related challenges in ECG analysis, as observed in the CPSC 2018 dataset. Specifically, we propose the application of feature fusion based on the wavelet transform, with a focus on wavelet transform-based interclass fusion, to generate the training feature library and the test set feature library. Subsequently, the original training and test data are amalgamated with their respective feature databases, resulting in more balanced training and test datasets. Employing this approach, our ECG model achieves recognition accuracies of up to 99%, 98%, 97%, 98%, 96%, 92%, and 93% for Normal, AF, I-AVB, LBBB, RBBB, PAC, PVC, STD, and STE, respectively. Furthermore, the average recognition accuracy for these categories ranges between 92\\% and 98\\%. Notably, our proposed data fusion methodology surpasses any known algorithms in terms of ECG classification accuracy in the CPSC 2018 dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86ECG\u6570\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86CPSC 2018\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2dECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u6570\u636e\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u5fc3\u810f\u72b6\u51b5\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u72b6\u51b5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cECG\u91c7\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1. \u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6280\u672f\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u5e93\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u5e93\uff1b2. \u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u540c\u5176\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u52a0\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ECG\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6b63\u5e38\u3001\u623f\u98a4\u3001I\u5ea6\u623f\u5ba4\u4f20\u5bfc\u963b\u6ede\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8699%\u300198%\u300197%\u7b49\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ecb\u4e8e92%\u81f398%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3ECG\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728CPSC 2018\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684ECG\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Our key contribution is a multi-model annotation framework leveraging a core insight: disagreement between frontier LLMs signals hard examples most valuable for training. We mine boundary cases where two strong annotators conflict, using a judge to resolve labels. This approach outperforms single-model distillation by 2.4 percent, with judge-resolved samples improving generalization despite higher training loss (0.421 vs 0.393) - evidence that disagreement mining acts as implicit regularization.

Yet in many engineering settings, varying geometry induces discrete structural changes, including topological changes, abrupt changes in boundary conditions or boundary types, and changes in the effective computational domain, which break the smooth-variation premise. Here we introduce Discrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL), a complementary paradigm that learns discrete solution procedures rather than continuous function-space operators. DiSOL factorizes the solver into learnable stages that mirror classical discretizations: local contribution encoding, multiscale assembly, and implicit solution reconstruction on an embedded grid, thereby preserving procedure-level consistency while adapting to geometry-dependent discrete structures. Across geometry-dependent Poisson, advection-diffusion, linear elasticity, as well as spatiotemporal heat-conduction problems, DiSOL produces stable and accurate predictions under both in-distribution and strongly out-of-distribution geometries, including discontinuous boundaries and topological changes. These results highlight the need for procedural operator representations in geometry-dominated regimes and position discrete solution operator learning as a distinct, complementary direction in scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DiSOL\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7b97\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b97\u5b50\u3002DiSOL\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5916\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u5747\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7b97\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u52a0\u901fPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5de5\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u7c7b\u578b\u7a81\u53d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u57df\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u7531\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aDiscrete Solution Operator Learning (DiSOL)\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u662f\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7b97\u7a0b\u5e8f\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b97\u5b50\u3002DiSOL\u5c06\u89e3\u7b97\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u6210\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9636\u6bb5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u79bb\u6563\u5316\uff1a\u5c40\u90e8\u8d21\u732e\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ec4\u88c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5d4c\u5165\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u89e3\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u5bf9\u6d41\u6269\u6563\u3001\u7ebf\u6027\u5f39\u6027\u53ca\u65f6\u7a7a\u70ed\u4f20\u5bfc\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cDiSOL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u5728\u5f3a\u70c8\u8d85\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u4ee5\u51e0\u4f55\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u91c7\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u800c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) is recognized for student modeling task due to its superior performance and application potential in education. To this end, we conceptualize and investigate counterfactual explanation as the connection from XAI for KT to education. Counterfactual explanations offer actionable recourse, are inherently causal and local, and easy for educational stakeholders to understand who are often non-experts. We propose KTCF, a counterfactual explanation generation method for KT that accounts for knowledge concept relationships, and a post-processing scheme that converts a counterfactual explanation into a sequence of educational instructions. We experiment on a large-scale educational dataset and show our KTCF method achieves superior and robust performance over existing methods, with improvements ranging from 5.7% to 34% across metrics. Additionally, we provide a qualitative evaluation of our post-processing scheme, demonstrating that the resulting educational instructions help in reducing large study burden. We show that counterfactuals have the potential to advance the responsible and practical use of AI in education.

We consider a setting where arms in a cluster may have different distributions. Unlike existing results in this setting, which assume Gaussian-distributed arms, we study a broader class of vector-parametric distributions that satisfy mild regularity conditions. Existing asymptotically optimal BC algorithms require solving an optimization problem as part of their sampling rule at each step, which is computationally costly. We propose an Efficient Bandit Clustering algorithm (EBC), which, instead of solving the full optimization problem, takes a single step toward the optimal value at each time step, making it computationally efficient while remaining asymptotically optimal. We also propose a heuristic variant of EBC, called EBC-H, which further simplifies the sampling rule, with arm selection based on quantities computed as part of the stopping rule.

We prove the existence and non-uniqueness of operator families satisfying these axioms, establishing that multiple distinct aggregation mechanisms conform to the same foundational principles.\n  Within this framework, we establish operator-agnostic guarantees showing that multi-teacher aggregation reduces both stochastic variance and systematic supervisory bias under heterogeneous teachers, while providing Jensen-type bounds, log-loss guarantees, and safety attenuation properties. For aggregation operators linear in teacher weights, we further establish classical ensemble variance-reduction results under standard independence assumptions, with extensions to correlated-error regimes.

A key challenge lies in sample-wise imbalance within the forget set: different samples exhibit widely varying unlearning difficulty, leading to asynchronous forgetting where some knowledge remains insufficiently erased while others become over-forgotten. To address this, we propose BalDRO, a novel and efficient framework for balanced LLM unlearning. BalDRO formulates unlearning as a min-sup process: an inner step identifies a worst-case data distribution that emphasizes hard-to-unlearn samples, while an outer step updates model parameters under this distribution. We instantiate BalDRO via two efficient variants: BalDRO-G, a discrete GroupDRO-based approximation focusing on high-loss subsets, and BalDRO-DV, a continuous Donsker-Varadhan dual method enabling smooth adaptive weighting within standard training pipelines. Experiments on TOFU and MUSE show that BalDRO significantly improves both forgetting quality and model utility over existing methods, and we release code for reproducibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6BalDRO\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316-\u4e0a\u754c\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cBalDRO\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u5728\u7ebf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5220\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u5fd8\u8bb0\u96c6\u5185\u90e8\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u88ab\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u672a\u5145\u5206\u6e05\u9664\u3002", "method": "BalDRO\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2amin-sup\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5185\u5c42\u6b65\u9aa4\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5f3a\u8c03\u96be\u4ee5\u5fd8\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5916\u5c42\u6b65\u9aa4\u5219\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5206\u5e03\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563GroupDRO\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u635f\u5931\u5b50\u96c6\u7684BalDRO-G\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eedDonsker-Varadhan\u5bf9\u5076\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u5185\u5e73\u6ed1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u7684BalDRO-DV\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728TOFU\u548cMUSE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cBalDRO\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BalDRO\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u3002"}}

Raju"], "title": "Geometric Stability: The Missing Axis of Representations", "comment": null, "summary": "Analysis of learned representations has a blind spot: it focuses on $similarity$, measuring how closely embeddings align with external references, but similarity reveals only what is represented, not whether that structure is robust. We introduce $geometric$ $stability$, a distinct dimension that quantifies how reliably representational geometry holds under perturbation, and present $Shesha$, a framework for measuring it. Across 2,463 configurations in seven domains, we show that stability and similarity are empirically uncorrelated ($\u03c1\\approx 0.01$) and mechanistically distinct: similarity metrics collapse after removing the top principal components, while stability retains sensitivity to fine-grained manifold structure. This distinction yields actionable insights: for safety monitoring, stability acts as a functional geometric canary, detecting structural drift nearly 2$\\times$ more sensitively than CKA while filtering out the non-functional noise that triggers false alarms in rigid distance metrics; for controllability, supervised stability predicts linear steerability ($\u03c1= 0.89$-$0.96$); for model selection, stability dissociates from transferability, revealing a geometric tax that transfer optimization incurs. Beyond machine learning, stability predicts CRISPR perturbation coherence and neural-behavioral coupling.

To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel pruning method, $D^2Prune$. First, we propose a dual Taylor expansion-based method that jointly models weight and activation perturbations for precise error estimation, leading to precise pruning mask selection and weight updating and facilitating error minimization during pruning. % Second, we propose an attention-aware dynamic update strategy that preserves the long-tail attention pattern by jointly minimizing the KL divergence of attention distributions and the reconstruction error. Extensive experiments show that $D^2Prune$ consistently outperforms SOTA methods across various LLMs (e.g., OPT-125M, LLaMA2/3, and Qwen3).

However, existing Transformer-based methods mostly inject temporal information only via positional encodings, relying on shared or parametric decay structures, which limits their ability to capture heterogeneous and type-specific temporal effects. Inspired by this observation, we derive a novel attention operator called Hawkes Attention from the multivariate Hawkes process theory for MTPP, using learnable per-type neural kernels to modulate query, key and value projections, thereby replacing the corresponding parts in the traditional attention. Benefited from the design, Hawkes Attention unifies event timing and content interaction, learning both the time-relevant behavior and type-specific excitation patterns from the data. The experimental results show that our method achieves better performance compared to the baselines. In addition to the general MTPP, our attention mechanism can also be easily applied to specific temporal structures, such as time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014Hawkes Attention\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cfHawkes\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u6ce8\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5171\u4eab\u6216\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u591a\u53d8\u91cfHawkes\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7406\u8bba\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08MTPP\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHawkes Attention\u7684\u65b0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6bcf\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6838\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u952e\u548c\u503c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u822cMTPP\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8fd8\u80fd\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Hawkes Attention\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u7c7b\u578b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6fc0\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Taylor"], "title": "Reward Learning through Ranking Mean Squared Error", "comment": null, "summary": "Reward design remains a significant bottleneck in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world problems. A popular alternative is reward learning, where reward functions are inferred from human feedback rather than manually specified. Recent work has proposed learning reward functions from human feedback in the form of ratings, rather than traditional binary preferences, enabling richer and potentially less cognitively demanding supervision. Building on this paradigm, we introduce a new rating-based RL method, Ranked Return Regression for RL (R4). At its core, R4 employs a novel ranking mean squared error (rMSE) loss, which treats teacher-provided ratings as ordinal targets. Our approach learns from a dataset of trajectory-rating pairs, where each trajectory is labeled with a discrete rating (e.g., \"bad,\" \"neutral,\" \"good\"). At each training step, we sample a set of trajectories, predict their returns, and rank them using a differentiable sorting operator (soft ranks). We then optimize a mean squared error loss between the resulting soft ranks and the teacher's ratings. Unlike prior rating-based approaches, R4 offers formal guarantees: its solution set is provably minimal and complete under mild assumptions. Empirically, using simulated human feedback, we demonstrate that R4 consistently matches or outperforms existing rating and preference-based RL methods on robotic locomotion benchmarks from OpenAI Gym and the DeepMind Control Suite, while requiring significantly less feedback.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5R4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u66f4\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u624b\u52a8\u6307\u5b9a\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u76d1\u7763\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e30\u5bcc\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRanked Return Regression for RL (R4)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08rMSE\uff09\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6559\u5e08\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u6570\u76ee\u6807\u3002R4\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8f68\u8ff9-\u8bc4\u5206\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f68\u8ff9\u90fd\u9644\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u9009\u53d6\u4e00\u7ec4\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u56de\u62a5\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f6f\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u8bc4\u5206\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u65f6\uff0cR4\u5728OpenAI Gym\u548cDeepMind Control Suite\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u79fb\u52a8\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684RL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6240\u9700\u53cd\u9988\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "R4\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u89e3\u96c6\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u4e14\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Specifically, cost-effective exogenous data (e.g., local weather) can unilaterally influence dynamics of endogenous variables, such as lake surface temperature. Exploiting these links enables more effective forecasts when exogenous inputs are readily available. Transformer-based models capture long-range dependencies but incur high computation and suffer from permutation invariance. Patch-based variants improve efficiency yet can miss local temporal patterns. To efficiently exploit informative signals across both the temporal dimension and relevant exogenous variables, this study proposes XLinear, a lightweight time series forecasting model built upon MultiLayer Perceptrons (MLPs). XLinear uses a global token derived from an endogenous variable as a pivotal hub for interacting with exogenous variables, and employs MLPs with sigmoid activation to extract both temporal patterns and variate-wise dependencies. Its prediction head then integrates these signals to forecast the endogenous series. We evaluate XLinear on seven standard benchmarks and five real-world datasets with exogenous inputs. Compared with state-of-the-art models, XLinear delivers superior accuracy and efficiency for both multivariate forecasts and univariate forecasts influenced by exogenous inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bXLinear\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\uff08MLP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709Sigmoid\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684MLP\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cXLinear\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u957f\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u662f\u5747\u5300\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u6392\u5217\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u9519\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86XLinear\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668(MLP)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002XLinear\u91c7\u7528\u4ece\u5185\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u5168\u5c40token\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u67a2\u7ebd\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5e26\u6709Sigmoid\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684MLP\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u90e8\u5206\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u751f\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u548c\u4e94\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9XLinear\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd8\u662f\u53d7\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cXLinear\u90fd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "XLinear\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5916\u751f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose Reward Informed Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a simple yet effective framework that utilizes all self-generated samples. Unlike the hard thresholding of RFT, RIFT repurposes negative trajectories, reweighting the loss with scalar rewards to learn from both the positive and negative trajectories from the model outputs.

Preprint", "summary": "Learning under unobservable feedback reliability poses a distinct challenge beyond optimization robustness: a system must decide whether to learn from an experience, not only how to learn stably. We study this setting as Epistemic Identifiability under Unobservable Reliability (EIUR), where each experience has a latent credibility, reliable and unreliable feedback can be locally indistinguishable, and data are generated in a closed loop by the learner's own evolving beliefs and actions. In EIUR, standard robust learning can converge stably yet form high-confidence, systematically wrong beliefs.\n  We propose metacognitive regulation as a practical response: a second, introspective control loop that infers experience credibility from endogenous evidence in the learner's internal dynamics. We formalize this as a modular Monitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR) decomposition and instantiate it with self-diagnosis, which maintains a slowly varying experience-trust variable that softly modulates learning updates, without exogenous reliability labels or an explicit corruption model.\n  Empirically, in the EIUR regimes studied here, self-diagnosis is associated with improved epistemic identifiability. In reinforcement learning, it enables calibrated skepticism and recovery under systematically corrupted rewards. In supervised learning, it exposes a critical dissociation: performance recovery does not imply epistemic recovery. Accuracy can rebound while internal belief dynamics remain locked-in by early misleading data, a failure detectable only through introspective diagnostics. Together, MTR and self-diagnosis provide an organizing abstraction and a concrete design template for intrinsic reliability assessment in autonomous learning under unobservable reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\uff08metacognitive regulation\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f13\u6162\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4fe1\u4efb\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8f6f\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6807\u7b7e\u6216\u660e\u786e\u7684\u635f\u574f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc6\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u51b3\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u5426\u4ece\u67d0\u4e2a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4f46\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u8c03\u8282\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aMonitor-Trust-Regulator (MTR)\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u636e\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u6e29\u548c\u5730\u8c03\u8282\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728EIUR\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0e\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u6821\u51c6\u6000\u7591\u5e76\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7be1\u6539\u65f6\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5219\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u5e76\u4e0d\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8ba4\u77e5\u6062\u590d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "MTR\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u62bd\u8c61\u53ca\u5177\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating crystals, their application to MOFs is hindered by MOFs' high atomic complexity. Inspired by the success of block-wise paradigms in deep generative models, we pioneer the use of LLMs in this domain by introducing MOF-LLM, the first LLM framework specifically adapted for block-level MOF structure prediction. To effectively harness LLMs for this modular assembly task, our training paradigm integrates spatial-aware continual pre-training (CPT), structural supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and matching-driven reinforcement learning (RL). By incorporating explicit spatial priors and optimizing structural stability via Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), our approach substantially enhances the spatial reasoning capability of a Qwen-3 8B model for accurate MOF structure prediction.

To address these challenges, we propose GeoRA (Geometry-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation), which exploits the anisotropic and compressible nature of RL update subspaces. GeoRA initializes adapters by extracting principal directions via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) within a geometrically constrained subspace while freezing the residual components. This method preserves the pre-trained geometric structure and enables efficient GPU computation through dense operators. Experiments on Qwen and Llama demonstrate that GeoRA mitigates optimization bottlenecks caused by geometric misalignment. It consistently outperforms established low-rank baselines on key mathematical benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, GeoRA shows superior generalization and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in out-of-domain tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGeoRA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528RL\u66f4\u65b0\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u538b\u7f29\u6027\uff0cGeoRA\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoRA\u5728\u5173\u952e\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6297\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PiSSA\u548cMiLoRA\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u672a\u80fd\u8003\u8651RLVR\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5149\u8c31\u584c\u9677\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u9047\u5230\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GeoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "GeoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51bb\u7ed3\u5269\u4f59\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684GPU\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoRA\u80fd\u591f\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u9519\u4f4d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728Qwen\u548cLlama\u4e0a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cGeoRA\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5bf9\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u62b5\u6297\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0cGeoRA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These sequences start with geometry provided by a designer and build up the points and curves of the final profile step by step. We demonstrate that adding construction steps between the designer's input geometry and the final profile improves generation quality in a similar way to the introduction of a chain of thought in language models. Similar to the constraints in a parametric CAD model, the construction sequences reduce the degrees of freedom in the modeled shape to a small set of parameter values which can be adjusted by the designer, allowing parametric editing with the constructed geometry evaluated to floating point precision. In addition we show that applying reinforcement learning to the construction sequences gives further improvements over a wide range of metrics, including some which were not explicitly optimized.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u9020\u751f\u6210CAD\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6784\u9020\u5305\u62ec\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u76f8\u4ea4\u3002\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u9010\u6b65\u6784\u5efa\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u70b9\u548c\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6784\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6784\u9020\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08CAD\uff09\u4e2d\u8f6e\u5ed3\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u64cd\u4f5c\u5982\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u53ca\u76f8\u4ea4\u7b49\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u5efa\u7acb\u6700\u7ec8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u51cf\u5c11\u5f62\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u81f3\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u8c03\u53c2\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u8fdb\u884c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u51e0\u4f55\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff1a\u66f2\u7ebf\u504f\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u4ea4\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\uff09\u9010\u6b65\u5f62\u6210\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f6e\u5ed3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6784\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e08\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u51e0\u4f55\u4f53\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4e4b\u95f4\u6dfb\u52a0\u6784\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8f6e\u5ed3\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u5f53\u5e94\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e8e\u6784\u9020\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6784\u9020\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u751f\u6210CAD\u8f6e\u5ed3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

Counterfactual and semi-factual explanations have emerged as two mechanisms for providing users with insights into the outputs of their models. We provide an overview of the computational complexity results in the literature for generating these explanations, finding that in many cases, generating explanations is computationally hard. We strengthen the argument for this considerably by further contributing our own inapproximability results showing that not only are explanations often hard to generate, but under certain assumptions, they are also hard to approximate.

Most existing Transformer-based forecasting models adopt vision-centric architectures that neglect the Earth's spherical geometry and zonal periodicity. In addition, conventional autoregressive training is computationally expensive and limits forecast horizons due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose the Shifted Earth Transformer (Searth Transformer), a physics-informed architecture that incorporates zonal periodicity and meridional boundaries into window-based self-attention for physically consistent global information exchange. We further introduce a Relay Autoregressive (RAR) fine-tuning strategy that enables learning long-range atmospheric evolution under constrained memory and computational budgets. Based on these methods, we develop YanTian, a global medium-range weather forecasting model. YanTian achieves higher accuracy than the high-resolution forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and performs competitively with state-of-the-art AI models at one-degree resolution, while requiring roughly 200 times lower computational cost than standard autoregressive fine-tuning. Furthermore, YanTian attains a longer skillful forecast lead time for Z500 (10.3 days) than HRES (9 days). Beyond weather forecasting, this work establishes a robust algorithmic foundation for predictive modeling of complex global-scale geophysical circulation systems, offering new pathways for Earth system science.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578bYanTian\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eShifted Earth Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548cRelay Autoregressive\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u7684\u7403\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9884\u62a5\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Shifted Earth Transformer\uff08Searth Transformer\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u7eac\u5411\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u7ecf\u5411\u8fb9\u754c\u7eb3\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u7403\u4fe1\u606f\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u63a5\u529b\u5f0f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\uff08RAR\uff09\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u957f\u671f\u5927\u6c14\u6f14\u53d8\u3002", "result": "YanTian\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6b27\u6d32\u4e2d\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u5ea6\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5fae\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u7ea6200\u500d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eZ500\u6307\u6807\uff0cYanTian\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8610.3\u5929\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u524d\u671f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eHRES\u76849\u5929\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9664\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u80fd\u529b\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u5168\u7403\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u5faa\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u7cfb\u7edf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

This makes it a valuable tool in LLM development, offering a competitive alternative to multi-task training. However, merging can be difficult at scale, as successful merging requires choosing the right merge operator, selecting the right models, and merging them in the right order. This often leads researchers to run expensive merge-and-evaluate searches to select the best merge. In this work, we provide an alternative by introducing \\simmerge{}, \\emph{a predictive merge-selection method} that selects the best merge using inexpensive, task-agnostic similarity signals between models. From a small set of unlabeled probes, we compute functional and structural features and use them to predict the performance of a given 2-way merge. Using these predictions, \\simmerge{} selects the best merge operator, the subset of models to merge, and the merge order, eliminating the expensive merge-and-evaluate loop. We demonstrate that we surpass standard merge-operator performance on 2-way merges of 7B-parameter LLMs, and that \\simmerge{} generalizes to multi-way merges and 111B-parameter LLM merges without retraining. Additionally, we present a bandit variant that supports adding new tasks, models, and operators on the fly. Our results suggest that learning how to merge is a practical route to scalable model composition when checkpoint catalogs are large and evaluation budgets are tight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSimMerge\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5ec9\u4ef7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5408\u5e76-\u8bc4\u4f30\u5faa\u73af\u3002SimMerge\u4e0d\u4ec5\u572870\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e24\u5408\u5e76\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u8def\u5408\u5e76\u53ca1110\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u6dfb\u52a0\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u987a\u5e8f\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5408\u5e76-\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SimMerge\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u63a2\u9488\u8ba1\u7b97\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e8c\u5143\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0cSimMerge\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3001\u5f85\u5408\u5e76\u6a21\u578b\u5b50\u96c6\u53ca\u5176\u5408\u5e76\u987a\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "SimMerge\u572870\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u4e24\u5408\u5e76\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u5408\u5e76\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5927\u578b\uff08\u59821110\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u6216\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u8def\u5408\u5e76\u573a\u666f\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684bandit\u7248\u672c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5373\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u65b0\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5e9e\u5927\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u76ee\u5f55\u4e0e\u6709\u9650\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u65f6\u3002"}}

Theoretically, we characterize the value function by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and derive the optimal feedback control as the minimizer of the associated Hamiltonian. We show that as the control penalty increases, the controlled process recovers the reference distribution, while as the penalty vanishes, the terminal law converges to a generalized Wasserstein projection onto the constraint manifold. Algorithmically, we introduce Terminal Optimal Control with Flow-based models (TOCFlow), a geometry-aware sampling-time guidance method for pre-trained flows. Solving the control problem in a terminal co-moving frame that tracks reference trajectories yields a closed-form scalar damping factor along the Riemannian gradient, capturing second-order curvature effects without matrix inversions. TOCFlow therefore matches the geometric consistency of Gauss-Newton updates at the computational cost of standard gradient guidance. We evaluate TOCFlow on three high-dimensional scientific tasks spanning equality, inequality, and global statistical constraints, namely Darcy flow, constrained trajectory planning, and turbulence snapshot generation with Kolmogorov spectral scaling. Across all settings, TOCFlow improves constraint satisfaction over Euclidean guidance and projection baselines while preserving the reference model's generative quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTOCFlow\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u9ad8\u7ef4\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e0c\u671b\u80fd\u591f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u503c\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86TOCFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u5177\u5907\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u6307\u5bfc\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u62ecDarcy\u6d41\u3001\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b26\u5408Kolmogorov\u8c31\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u5feb\u7167\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5728\u5185\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cTOCFlow\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "TOCFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u7ec8\u7aef\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Current approaches to training single-head looped architectures on benchmark tasks frequently fail or yield suboptimal performance due to a highly non-convex and irregular loss landscape. In these settings, optimization often stagnates in poor local minima and saddle points of the loss landscape, preventing the model from discovering the global minimum point. The internal mechanisms of these single-head looped transformer models remain poorly understood, and training them from scratch remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework that leverages Tsallis entropy and Hamiltonian dynamics to transform the geometry of the loss landscape. By treating the parameter updates as a physical flow, we successfully trained a single-head looped Transformer with model dimension $d = 8$ to solve induction head task with input sequence length of 1000 tokens. This success reveals the internal mechanism behind the superior reasoning capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528Tsallis\u71b5\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u5934\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a1000\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u5934\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u975e\u5e38\u975e\u51f8\u4e14\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5f80\u5f80\u505c\u6ede\u4e8e\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u826f\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u548c\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u70b9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5355\u5934\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u96f6\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b83\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528Tsallis\u71b5\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u53d8\u6362\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7ef4\u5ea6$d=8$\u7684\u5355\u5934\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u89e3\u51b3\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u8fbe1000\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5934\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u5934\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u5353\u8d8a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We study this problem from a mechanistic perspective based on model circuits--structured interaction pathways that govern how predictions are formed. We propose Circuit-guided Unlearning Difficulty (CUD), a {\\em pre-unlearning} metric that assigns each sample a continuous difficulty score using circuit-level signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CUD reliably separates intrinsically easy and hard samples, and remains stable across unlearning methods. We identify key circuit-level patterns that reveal a mechanistic signature of difficulty: easy-to-unlearn samples are associated with shorter, shallower interactions concentrated in earlier-to-intermediate parts of the original model, whereas hard samples rely on longer and deeper pathways closer to late-stage computation. Compared to existing qualitative studies, CUD takes a first step toward a principled, fine-grained, and interpretable analysis of unlearning difficulty; and motivates the development of unlearning methods grounded in model mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u7535\u8def\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\uff08CUD\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u5220\u9664\u524d\u5c31\u80fd\u6839\u636e\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCUD\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5728\u5bb9\u6613\u4e0e\u96be\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bb9\u6613\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u8f83\u77ed\u3001\u8f83\u6d45\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u540e\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u66f4\u957f\u66f4\u6df1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u5408\u89c4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f53\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u673a\u5236\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7535\u8def\u2014\u2014\u5373\u51b3\u5b9a\u9884\u6d4b\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6(CUD)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u9057\u5fd8\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u8def\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86CUD\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u6613\u4e8e\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5173\u952e\u7535\u8def\u6a21\u5f0f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u6613\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u5230\u4e2d\u671f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8f83\u77ed\u3001\u8f83\u6d45\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6709\u5173\uff1b\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u540e\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u66f4\u957f\u66f4\u6df1\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0cCUD\u671d\u5411\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u96be\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u673a\u5236\u5f00\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditions, whereas full supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often reduces accuracy or calibration quality. This work presents the first comprehensive study of fine-tuning in TFMs across benchmarks including TALENT, OpenML-CC18, and TabZilla. We compare Zero-Shot, Meta-Learning, Supervised (SFT), and parameter-efficient (PEFT) approaches, analyzing how dataset factors such as imbalance, size, and dimensionality affect outcomes.

By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performance of individual tasks compared to single-task fine-tuning. This problem is exacerbated in LoRA due to the low-rank constraint, which limits the optimization landscape's capacity to accommodate diverse task requirements. In this paper, we propose Ortho-LoRA, a gradient projection method specifically tailored for the bipartite structure of LoRA. Ortho-LoRA dynamically projects conflicting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of each other within the intrinsic LoRA subspace. Extensive experiments on the GLUE benchmark demonstrate that Ortho-LoRA effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming standard joint training and recovering 95\\% of the performance gap between multi-task and single-task baselines with negligible computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOrtho-LoRA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5f7c\u6b64\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60(MTL)\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94(LoRA)\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u51b2\u7a81\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8eLoRA\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5176\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Ortho-LoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9LoRA\u7684\u53cc\u90e8\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728LoRA\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u628a\u76f8\u4e92\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5c04\u5230\u5bf9\u65b9\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u8865\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u5728GLUE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cOrtho-LoRA\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e4b\u95f495%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "Ortho-LoRA\u4e3a\u91c7\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u8d1f\u9762\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Contrastive Geometric Learning for Unified Computational Drug Design (ConGLUDe), a single contrastive geometric model that unifies structure- and ligand-based training. ConGLUDe couples a geometric protein encoder that produces whole-protein representations and implicit embeddings of predicted binding sites with a fast ligand encoder, removing the need for pre-defined pockets. By aligning ligands with both global protein representations and multiple candidate binding sites through contrastive learning, ConGLUDe supports ligand-conditioned pocket prediction in addition to virtual screening and target fishing, while being trained jointly on protein-ligand complexes and large-scale bioactivity data. Across diverse benchmarks, ConGLUDe achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot virtual screening performance in settings where no binding pocket information is provided as input, substantially outperforms existing methods on a challenging target fishing task, and demonstrates competitive ligand-conditioned pocket selection. These results highlight the advantages of unified structure-ligand training and position ConGLUDe as a step toward general-purpose foundation models for drug discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5ConGLUDe\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u9884\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u9776\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u4ee5\u53ca\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u4f53\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u836f\u7269\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ConGLUDe\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "ConGLUDe\u5229\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u6574\u4e2a\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u9690\u542b\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u86cb\u767d\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u914d\u4f53\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4f7f\u914d\u4f53\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u7ed3\u5408\u4f4d\u70b9\u76f8\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9664\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u9776\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u5916\u8fd8\u5177\u5907\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53e3\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "ConGLUDe\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u5408\u53e3\u888b\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\uff1b\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u914d\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53e3\u888b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u76f8\u5f53\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784-\u914d\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u8fc8\u8fdb\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}
