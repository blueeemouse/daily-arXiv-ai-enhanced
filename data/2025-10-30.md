Abstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

Abstract: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models
has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made
in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential
recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'
multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.
To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a
multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a
decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into
several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting
relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves
adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.
Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework
outperforms several competitive baselines.

Abstract: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools,
systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research
attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory
compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection
modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module.
The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80
human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools.
Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\%
respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert
annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions
across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based
analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision
require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more
claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation
requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to
human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain
surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural
defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

Abstract: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It
typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the
query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and
relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its
vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging
top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed
based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are
relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed
specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language
models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free
query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,
relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting
quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed
framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which
performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,
not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the
relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training
pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy
feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers
demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing
it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).
However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,
dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data.Content-based Semantic IDs
(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,
by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have
limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral
information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform
content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,
creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and
long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise
Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative
noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to
the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The
equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of
different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to
distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we
propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,
Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior
modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this
framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive
behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield
representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical
signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public
and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant
superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.

Abstract: Live streaming plays a major role in today's digital platforms, supporting
entertainment, education, social media, etc. However, research in this field is
limited by the lack of large, publicly available datasets that capture
real-time viewer behavior at scale. To address this gap, we introduce YTLive, a
public dataset focused on YouTube Live. Collected through the YouTube
Researcher Program over May and June 2024, YTLive includes more than 507000
records from 12156 live streams, tracking concurrent viewer counts at
five-minute intervals along with precise broadcast durations. We describe the
dataset design and collection process and present an initial analysis of
temporal viewing patterns. Results show that viewer counts are higher and more
stable on weekends, especially during afternoon hours. Shorter streams attract
larger and more consistent audiences, while longer streams tend to grow slowly
and exhibit greater variability. These insights have direct implications for
adaptive streaming, resource allocation, and Quality of Experience (QoE)
modeling. YTLive offers a timely, open resource to support reproducible
research and system-level innovation in live streaming. The dataset is publicly
available at github.

Abstract: We propose a novel task, hallucination localization in video captioning,
which aims to identify hallucinations in video captions at the span level (i.e.
individual words or phrases). This allows for a more detailed analysis of
hallucinations compared to existing sentence-level hallucination detection
task. To establish a benchmark for hallucination localization, we construct
HLVC-Dataset, a carefully curated dataset created by manually annotating 1,167
video-caption pairs from VideoLLM-generated captions. We further implement a
VideoLLM-based baseline method and conduct quantitative and qualitative
evaluations to benchmark current performance on hallucination localization.

Abstract: Vision-Language Large Models (VLLMs) face significant efficiency challenges
when processing high-resolution inputs. The quadratic complexity in attention
and autoregressive generation, as well as the constantly growing key value (KV)
cache size, severely hinder the prefilling and decoding stages. Recent efforts
have attempted to compress KV cache by identifying and pruning KV cache of less
important tokens, but these methods typically rely on attention scores to
estimate token importance, making them incompatible with efficient attention
mechanisms such as FlashAttention and Sparse Attention, which do not explicitly
compute attention matrices. Moreover, existing methods overlook how sparse
attention, while accelerating the prefilling stage, alters the information
structure of the KV cache, thereby compromising the effectiveness of downstream
KV cache compression strategies. To address this issue, we propose PureKV, a
plug-and-play framework for joint optimization of sparse attention and KV cache
compression. We first introduce a KV cache compression strategy that is fully
compatible with efficient attention accelerators. Our method utilizes lower
layer attention scores to estimate the importance of high layers' KV cache,
enabling active pruning without compromising accuracy. In addition, we have
designed a Spatial-Temporal Sparse Attention (ST-SpAttn) module specifically
tailored for video KV cache compression algorithms. This module combines
spatial and temporal attention sparsity to improve the compression efficiency
of KV cache optimization algorithms by purifying spatial noise and temporal
redundancy in KV cache. At the same time, ST-SpAttn also accelerated the
prefilling stage of VLLMs. Extensive experiments on VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2,
Qwen2.5-VL) have shown that PureKV achieves 5.0 times KV cache compression and
3.16 times prefill acceleration, with negligible quality degradation.
