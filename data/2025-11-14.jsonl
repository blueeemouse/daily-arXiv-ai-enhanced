However, existing multi-stage advertising recommendation systems suffer from objective misalignment and error propagation, making it difficult to achieve global optimality, while unified generative recommendation models still struggle to meet the demands of practical industrial applications. To address these issues, we propose GPR (Generative Pre-trained Recommender), the first one-model framework that redefines advertising recommendation as an end-to-end generative task, replacing the traditional cascading paradigm with a unified generative approach. To realize GPR, we introduce three key innovations spanning unified representation, network architecture, and training strategy. First, we design a unified input schema and tokenization method tailored to advertising scenarios, mapping both ads and organic content into a shared multi-level semantic ID space, thereby enhancing semantic alignment and modeling consistency across heterogeneous data. Second, we develop the Heterogeneous Hierarchical Decoder (HHD), a dual-decoder architecture that decouples user intent modeling from ad generation, achieving a balance between training efficiency and inference flexibility while maintaining strong modeling capacity. Finally, we propose a multi-stage joint training strategy that integrates Multi-Token Prediction (MTP), Value-Aware Fine-Tuning and the Hierarchy Enhanced Policy Optimization (HEPO) algorithm, forming a complete generative recommendation pipeline that unifies interest modeling, value alignment, and policy optimization. GPR has been fully deployed in the Tencent Weixin Channels advertising system, delivering significant improvements in key business metrics including GMV and CTCVR."}

To this end, industrial practitioners have accumulated vast amounts of structured domain knowledge, which we term human priors (e.g., item taxonomies, temporal patterns). This knowledge is typically applied through post-hoc adjustments during ranking or post-ranking. However, this approach remains decoupled from the core model learning, which is particularly undesirable as the industry shifts to end-to-end generative recommendation foundation models. On the other hand, many methods targeting these beyond-accuracy objectives often require architecture-specific modifications and discard these valuable human priors by learning user intent in a fully unsupervised manner.\n  Instead of discarding the human priors accumulated over years of practice, we introduce a backbone-agnostic framework that seamlessly integrates these human priors directly into the end-to-end training of generative recommenders. With lightweight, prior-conditioned adapter heads inspired by efficient LLM decoding strategies, our approach guides the model to disentangle user intent along human-understandable axes (e.g., interaction types, long- vs. short-term interests). We also introduce a hierarchical composition strategy for modeling complex interactions across different prior types. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances both accuracy and beyond-accuracy objectives. We also show that human priors allow the backbone model to more effectively leverage longer context lengths and larger model sizes."}

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks."}

In real-world scenarios, however, the presence of missing modalities and noisy signals significantly hinders the robustness and accuracy of existing models. While prior works have made progress on these issues, they are typically addressed in isolation, limiting overall effectiveness in practical settings. To jointly mitigate the challenges posed by missing and noisy modalities, we propose a framework called Two-stage Modality Denoising and Complementation (TMDC). TMDC comprises two sequential training stages. In the Intra-Modality Denoising Stage, denoised modality-specific and modality-shared representations are extracted from complete data using dedicated denoising modules, reducing the impact of noise and enhancing representational robustness. In the Inter-Modality Complementation Stage, these representations are leveraged to compensate for missing modalities, thereby enriching the available information and further improving robustness. Extensive evaluations on MOSI, MOSEI, and IEMOCAP demonstrate that TMDC consistently achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, establishing new state-of-the-art results."}
