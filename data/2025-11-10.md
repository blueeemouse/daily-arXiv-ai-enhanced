Abstract: Geotechnical reports are crucial for assessing the stability of rock
formations and ensuring safety in modern engineering. Traditionally, these
reports are prepared manually based on field observations using compasses,
magnifying glasses, and notebooks. This method is slow, prone to errors, and
subjective in its interpretations. To overcome these limitations, the use of
artificial intelligence techniques is proposed for the automatic generation of
reports through the processing of images and field data. The methodology was
based on the collection of photographs of rock outcrops and manual samples with
their respective descriptions, as well as on the reports prepared during the
Geotechnical Studies course. These resources were used to define the report
outline, prompt engineering, and validate the responses of a multimodal large
language model (MLLM). The iterative refinement of prompts until structured and
specific instructions were obtained for each section of the report proved to be
an effective alternative to the costly process of fine-tuning the MLLM. The
system evaluation establishes values of 0.455 and 0.653 for the BLEU and
ROUGE-L metrics, respectively, suggesting that automatic descriptions are
comparable to those made by experts. This tool, accessible via the web, with an
intuitive interface and the ability to export to standardized formats,
represents an innovation and an important contribution for professionals and
students of field geology.

Abstract: Prior to recent successes using neural networks, term frequency-inverse
document frequency (tf-idf) was clearly regarded as the best choice for
identifying documents related to a query. We provide a different score, aver,
and observe, on a dataset with ground truth marking for association, that aver
does do better at finding assciated pairs than tf-idf. This example involves
finding associated vertices in a large graph and that may be an area where
neural networks are not currently an obvious best choice. Beyond this one
anecdote, we observe that (1) aver has a natural threshold for declaring pairs
as unassociated while tf-idf does not, (2) aver can distinguish between pairs
of documents for which tf-idf gives a score of 1.0, (3) aver can be applied to
larger collections of documents than pairs while tf-idf cannot, and (4) that
aver is derived from entropy under a simple statistical model while tf-idf is a
construction designed to achieve a certain goal and hence aver may be more
"natural." To be fair, we also observe that (1) writing down and computing the
aver score for a pair is more complex than for tf-idf and (2) that the fact
that the aver score is naturally scale-free makes it more complicated to
interpret aver scores.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval systems are essential to contemporary AI pipelines, although most
confuse two separate processes: finding relevant information and giving enough
context for reasoning. We introduce the Search-Is-Not-Retrieve (SINR)
framework, a dual-layer architecture that distinguishes between fine-grained
search representations and coarse-grained retrieval contexts. SINR enhances the
composability, scalability, and context fidelity of retrieval systems by
directly connecting small, semantically accurate search chunks to larger,
contextually complete retrieve chunks, all without incurring extra processing
costs. This design changes retrieval from a passive step to an active one,
making the system architecture more like how people process information. We
discuss the SINR framework's conceptual foundation, formal structure,
implementation issues, and qualitative outcomes. This provides a practical
foundation for the next generation of AI systems that use retrieval.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As financial applications of large language models (LLMs) gain attention,
accurate Information Retrieval (IR) remains crucial for reliable AI services.
However, existing benchmarks fail to capture the complex and domain-specific
information needs of real-world banking scenarios. Building domain-specific IR
benchmarks is costly and constrained by legal restrictions on using real
customer data. To address these challenges, we propose a systematic methodology
for constructing domain-specific IR benchmarks through LLM-based query
generation. As a concrete implementation of this methodology, our pipeline
combines single and multi-document query generation with an enhanced and
reasoning-augmented answerability assessment method, achieving stronger
alignment with human judgments than prior approaches. Using this methodology,
we construct KoBankIR, comprising 815 queries derived from 204 official banking
documents. Our experiments show that existing retrieval models struggle with
the complex multi-document queries in KoBankIR, demonstrating the value of our
systematic approach for domain-specific benchmark construction and underscoring
the need for improved retrieval techniques in financial domains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel series of Russian information retrieval
datasets constructed from the "Did you know..." section of Russian Wikipedia.
Our datasets support a range of retrieval tasks, including fact-checking,
retrieval-augmented generation, and full-document retrieval, by leveraging
interesting facts and their referenced Wikipedia articles annotated at the
sentence level with graded relevance. We describe the methodology for dataset
creation that enables the expansion of existing Russian Information Retrieval
(IR) resources. Through extensive experiments, we extend the RusBEIR research
by comparing lexical retrieval models, such as BM25, with state-of-the-art
neural architectures fine-tuned for Russian, as well as multilingual models.
Results of our experiments show that lexical methods tend to outperform neural
models on full-document retrieval, while neural approaches better capture
lexical semantics in shorter texts, such as in fact-checking or fine-grained
retrieval. Using our newly created datasets, we also analyze the impact of
document length on retrieval performance and demonstrate that combining
retrieval with neural reranking consistently improves results. Our contribution
expands the resources available for Russian information retrieval research and
highlights the importance of accurate evaluation of retrieval models to achieve
optimal performance. All datasets are publicly available at HuggingFace. To
facilitate reproducibility and future research, we also release the full
implementation on GitHub.

Abstract: Generative Retrieval (GR) differs from the traditional index-then-retrieve
pipeline by storing relevance in model parameters and directly generating
document identifiers. However, GR often struggles to generalize and is costly
to scale. We introduce QUESTER (QUEry SpecificaTion gEnerative Retrieval),
which reframes GR as query specification generation - in this work, a simple
keyword query handled by BM25 - using a (small) LLM. The policy is trained
using reinforcement learning techniques (GRPO). Across in- and out-of-domain
evaluations, we show that our model is more effective than BM25, and
competitive with neural IR models, while maintaining a good efficiency

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) utilizes external knowledge to augment
Large Language Models' (LLMs) reliability. For flexibility, agentic RAG employs
autonomous, multi-round retrieval and reasoning to resolve queries. Although
recent agentic RAG has improved via reinforcement learning, they often incur
substantial token overhead from search and reasoning processes. This trade-off
prioritizes accuracy over efficiency. To address this issue, this work proposes
TeaRAG, a token-efficient agentic RAG framework capable of compressing both
retrieval content and reasoning steps. 1) First, the retrieved content is
compressed by augmenting chunk-based semantic retrieval with a graph retrieval
using concise triplets. A knowledge association graph is then built from
semantic similarity and co-occurrence. Finally, Personalized PageRank is
leveraged to highlight key knowledge within this graph, reducing the number of
tokens per retrieval. 2) Besides, to reduce reasoning steps, Iterative
Process-aware Direct Preference Optimization (IP-DPO) is proposed.
Specifically, our reward function evaluates the knowledge sufficiency by a
knowledge matching mechanism, while penalizing excessive reasoning steps. This
design can produce high-quality preference-pair datasets, supporting iterative
DPO to improve reasoning conciseness. Across six datasets, TeaRAG improves the
average Exact Match by 4% and 2% while reducing output tokens by 61% and 59% on
Llama3-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, respectively. Code is available at
https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/TeaRAG.
