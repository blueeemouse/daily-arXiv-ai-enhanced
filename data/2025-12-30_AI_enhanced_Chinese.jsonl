Generative Recommendation (GR) mitigates them through an end-to-end framework; however, existing methods still rely on matching mechanisms based on inductive patterns. Although responsive, they lack the ability to uncover complex user intents that require deductive reasoning based on world knowledge. Meanwhile, LLMs show strong deep reasoning capabilities, but their latency and computational costs remain challenging for industrial applications. More critically, there are performance bottlenecks in multi-scenario scalability: as shown in Figure 1, existing solutions require independent training and deployment for each scenario, leading to low resource utilization and high maintenance costs-a challenge unaddressed in GR literature. To address these, we present OxygenREC, an industrial recommendation system that leverages Fast-Slow Thinking to deliver deep reasoning with strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world environments. First, we adopt a Fast-Slow Thinking architecture. Slow thinking uses a near-line LLM pipeline to synthesize Contextual Reasoning Instructions, while fast thinking employs a high-efficiency encoder--decoder backbone for real-time generation. Second, to ensure reasoning instructions effectively enhance recommendation generation, we introduce a semantic alignment mechanism with Instruction-Guided Retrieval (IGR) to filter intent-relevant historical behaviors and use a Query-to-Item (Q2I) loss for instruction-item consistency. Finally, to resolve multi-scenario scalability, we transform scenario information into controllable instructions, using unified reward mapping and Soft Adaptive Group Clip Policy Optimization (SA-GCPO) to align policies with diverse business objectives, realizing a train-once-deploy-everywhere paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "OxygenREC, a novel recommendation system, integrates Fast-Slow Thinking to achieve deep reasoning and meet the strict latency and multi-scenario requirements of real-world applications.

Recent studies have demonstrated that learned cardinality estimation techniques can surpass traditional methods in accuracy. However, a significant barrier to their adoption in production systems is their tendency to violate fundamental logical principles such as monotonicity. In this paper, we explore how learned models specifically MSCN, a query driven deep learning algorithm can breach monotonicity constraints. To address this, we propose a metric called MonoM, which quantitatively measures how well a cardinality estimator adheres to monotonicity across a given query workload. We also propose a monotonic training framework which includes a workload generator that produces directly comparable queries (one query's predicates are strictly more relaxed than another's, enabling monotonicity inference without actual execution) and a novel regularization term added to the loss function. Experimental results show that our monotonic training algorithm not only enhances monotonicity adherence but also improves cardinality estimation accuracy.

We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query.

A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective.

Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5217\u7c7b\u578b\u6ce8\u91ca(CTA)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94(LoRA)\u8bad\u7ec3\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6bd4\u4ec5\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u52a0\u6743F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u8c03\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u5c06CTA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u975e\u5e38\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6807\u6ce8F1\u5206\u6570\u4ecd\u7136\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u7ec6\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u89c4\u6a21\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u540c\u6837\u672a\u80fd\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u52a0\u6743F1\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684CTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, LLMs sometimes generate hallucinations, i.e.,unrealistic or illogical content, which leads to incorrect SQL queries and negatively impacts downstream applications. Detecting these hallucinations is particularly challenging. Existing Text-to-SQL error detection methods, which are tailored for traditional deep learning models, face significant limitations when applied to LLMs. This is primarily due to the scarcity of ground-truth data. To address this challenge, we propose SQLHD, a novel hallucination detection method based on metamorphic testing (MT) that does not require standard answers. SQLHD splits the detection task into two sequentiial stages: schema-linking hallucination detection via eight structure-aware Metamorphic Relations (MRs) that perturb comparative words, entities, sentence structure or database schema, and logical-synthesis hallucination detection via nine logic-aware MRs that mutate prefix words, extremum expressions, comparison ranges or the entire database. In each stage the LLM is invoked separately to generate schema mappings or SQL artefacts; the follow-up outputs are cross-checked against their source counterparts through the corresponding MRs, and any violation is flagged as a hallucination without requiring ground-truth SQL. The experimental results demonstrate our method's superior performance in terms of the F1-score, which ranges from 69.36\\% to 82.76\\%. Additionally, SQLHD demonstrates superior performance over LLM Self-Evaluation methods, effectively identifying hallucinations in Text-to-SQL tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684SQL\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5SQLHD\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728F1\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u4ece69.36%\u523082.76%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u6587\u672c\u5230SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u65f6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u6216\u4e0d\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff08\u5373\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684SQL\u67e5\u8be2\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u4ea7\u751f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f6cSQL\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8eLLMs\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSQLHD\u7684\u65b0\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5f62\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08MT\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u51c6\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u516b\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u5173\u7cfb\uff08MRs\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u4e5d\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u611f\u77e5\u7684MRs\u8fdb\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u522b\u8c03\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\u6620\u5c04\u6216SQL\u5de5\u4ef6\uff1b\u540e\u7eed\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u6e90\u8f93\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5e94\u7684MRs\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u8fdd\u53cd\u90fd\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u7684SQL\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728F1\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u8303\u56f4\u4ece69.36%\u523082.76%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSQLHD\u5728\u8bc6\u522bText-to-SQL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u81ea\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SQLHD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5904\u7406LLMs\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8Text-to-SQL\u8f6c\u6362\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Wang", "Y. Cong"], "title": "Federated Multi-Task Clustering", "comment": null, "summary": "Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\uff08FMTC\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u534f\u4f5c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5e95\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFMTC\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u5206\u6563\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5173\u8054\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Federated Multi-Task Clustering (FMTC) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6837\u672c\u5916\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u5f20\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5171\u540c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5(ADMM)\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FMTC\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FMTC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent efforts toward edge-cloud collaboration have attempted to mitigate this issue, but most existing methods adopt coarse-grained task allocation strategies-assigning entire queries either to the edge or the cloud. Such rigid partitioning fails to exploit fine-grained reasoning parallelism and often leads to redundant computation and inefficient resource utilization. To this end, we propose HybridFlow, a resource-adaptive inference framework that enables fast and token-efficient collaborative reasoning between edge and cloud LLMs. HybridFlow operates in two stages: (1) task decomposition and parallel execution, which dynamically splits a complex query into interdependent subtasks that can execute as soon as their dependencies are resolved; and (2) resource-aware subtask routing, where a learned router adaptively assigns each subtask to the edge or cloud model according to predicted utility gains and real-time budget states. Comprehensive evaluations on GPQA, MMLU-Pro, AIME, and LiveBench-Reasoning demonstrate that HybridFlow effectively reduces end-to-end inference time and overall token usage while maintaining competitive accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHybridFlow\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u6267\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HybridFlow\u3002", "method": "HybridFlow\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff1a1\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5272\u6210\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u65e6\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u9879\u88ab\u89e3\u51b3\u5373\u53ef\u5f00\u59cb\u6267\u884c\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u6839\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6548\u7528\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u7b97\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u8fb9\u7f18\u6216\u4e91\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7GPQA\u3001MMLU-Pro\u3001AIME\u548cLiveBench-Reasoning\u7b49\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cHybridFlow\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u603b\u4f53\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HybridFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper presents an empirical study investigating whether LLM-generated code can be executed successfully in a clean environment with only OS packages and using only the dependencies that the model specifies. We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLM coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini) across 300 projects generated from 100 standardized prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java. We introduce a three-layer dependency framework (distinguishing between claimed, working, and runtime dependencies) to quantify execution reproducibility. Our results show that only 68.3% of projects execute out-of-the-box, with substantial variation across languages (Python 89.2%, Java 44.0%).

Code available at: https://github.com/Rajeeb321123/Latent_sculpting_using_two_stage_method", "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism.\n  We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn.\n  Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCleave\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e91\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e14\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8de8\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u7a7a\u95f2\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8d85\u51fa\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u5bb9\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8fd8\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "Cleave\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u5f20\u91cf\u5e76\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4ee5\u53c2\u6570\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bbe\u5907\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u901a\u4fe1\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u8bbe\u5907\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCleave\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5927\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u5343\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u51fa8\u500d\u3002\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6279\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a10\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u8bbe\u5907\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u81f3\u5c11\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Cleave\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u5bb9\u9519\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

This paper provides a comprehensive survey of buffer management evolution spanning four decades of research. We systematically analyze the progression from foundational algorithms like LRU-K, 2Q, LIRS, and ARC to contemporary machine learning-augmented policies and disaggregated memory architectures. Our survey examines the historical OS-DBMS architectural divergence, production system implementations in PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Linux, and emerging trends including eBPF-based kernel extensibility, NVM-aware tiering strategies, and RDMA-enabled memory disaggregation. Through analysis of over 50 seminal papers from leading conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, OSDI, FAST), we identify key architectural patterns, performance trade-offs, and open research challenges. We conclude by outlining a research direction that integrates machine learning with kernel extensibility mechanisms to enable adaptive, cross-layer buffer management for heterogeneous memory hierarchies in modern database systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5168\u9762\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u5174\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002\u6700\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u6838\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u5c42\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de8\u8d8a\u56db\u5341\u5e74\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6982\u8ff0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf-\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6765\u81eaSIGMOD\u3001VLDB\u3001OSDI\u3001FAST\u7b49\u9876\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8bae\u768450\u591a\u7bc7\u91cd\u8981\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4eceLRU-K\u30012Q\u3001LIRS\u3001ARC\u7b49\u57fa\u7840\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8f85\u52a9\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u89e3\u805a\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u5386\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u70b9\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u7ea7\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u7740\u91cd\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although widely publicized as a productivity breakthrough, little is known about how practitioners actually define and engage in these practices. To shed light on this emerging phenomenon, we conducted a grounded theory study of 20 vibe-coding videos, including 7 live-streamed coding sessions (about 16 hours, 254 prompts) and 13 opinion videos (about 5 hours), supported by additional analysis of activity durations and prompt intents. Our findings reveal a spectrum of behaviors: some vibe coders rely almost entirely on AI without inspecting code, while others examine and adapt generated outputs. Across approaches, all must contend with the stochastic nature of generation, with debugging and refinement often described as \"rolling the dice.\" Further, divergent mental models, shaped by vibe coders' expertise and reliance on AI, influence prompting strategies, evaluation practices, and levels of trust. These findings open new directions for research on the future of software engineering and point to practical opportunities for tool design and education.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u679020\u4e2avibe-coding\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u7f16\u7a0b\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5bf9AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u4eba\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u5bf9AI\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fe1\u4efb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u6781\u5927\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u8fd9\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u201c\u6c1b\u56f4\u7f16\u7801\u201d\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u73b0\u8c61\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u624e\u6839\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5305\u62ec7\u4e2a\u5b9e\u65f6\u7f16\u7801\u4f1a\u8bdd\uff08\u7ea616\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c254\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u548c13\u4e2a\u610f\u89c1\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u7ea65\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\u5728\u5185\u768420\u4e2avibe-coding\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6d3b\u52a8\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u610f\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u8c31\u7cfb\uff1a\u4e00\u4e9b\u6c1b\u56f4\u7f16\u7801\u8005\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u800c\u4e0d\u68c0\u67e5\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u5ba1\u67e5\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u9762\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8c03\u8bd5\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u5e38\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u2018\u63b7\u9ab0\u5b50\u2019\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6c1b\u56f4\u7f16\u7801\u8005\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9AI\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ca\u4fe1\u4efb\u5c42\u6b21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6559\u80b2\u57f9\u8bad\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Large language model methods often assume kernels can be compiled and executed cheaply, which fails in large applications where full builds and runs are expensive. We present an end-to-end LLM framework with performance feedback that optimizes kernels without building the full application. From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation.

Existing graph analysis systems, mostly based on static snapshots, struggle to effectively capture information flows along the temporal dimension. To address this challenge, we introduce ChronoConnect, a novel system that enables tracking temporal pathways in temporal graph, especially beneficial to downstream mining tasks, e.g., understanding what are the critical pathways in propagating information towards a specific group of vertices. Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChronoConnect\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5b83\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u5e94\u5bf9\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u6765\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u56fe\u5f62\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6fc0\u589e\uff0c\u5bf9\u56fe\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aChronoConnect\u7684\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u65b9\u4fbf\u5730\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u6267\u884c\u5404\u79cd\u65f6\u5e8f\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cChronoConnect\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\u7684\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e2d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u9876\u70b9\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86ChronoConnect\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7ed3\u679c\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "ChronoConnect\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u4e0a\u6269\u6563\u7684\u3002"}}

This task is fundamental yet challenging in automated software engineering due to the semantic gap between issue description and source code implementation. This gap manifests as two mismatches:(1) symptom-to-cause mismatches, where descriptions do not explicitly reveal underlying root causes; (2) one-to-many mismatches, where a single issue corresponds to multiple interdependent code entities. To address these two mismatches, we propose GraphLocator, an approach that mitigates symptom-to-cause mismatches through causal structure discovering and resolves one-to-many mismatches via dynamic issue disentangling. The key artifact is the causal issue graph (CIG), in which vertices represent discovered sub-issues along with their associated code entities, and edges encode the causal dependencies between them. The workflow of GraphLocator consists of two phases: symptom vertices locating and dynamic CIG discovering; it first identifies symptom locations on the repository graph, then dynamically expands the CIG by iteratively reasoning over neighboring vertices. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphLocator: (1) Compared with baselines, GraphLocator achieves more accurate localization with average improvements of +19.49% in function-level recall and +11.89% in precision. (2) GraphLocator outperforms baselines on both symptom-to-cause and one-to-many mismatch scenarios, achieving recall improvement of +16.44% and +19.18%, precision improvement of +7.78% and +13.23%, respectively.

However, efficiently deploying these systems on serverless GPU platforms presents significant resource allocation challenges due to heterogeneous agent workloads, varying computational demands, and the need for cost-effective scaling. This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668GPU\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u6027\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914dGPU\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b085%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668GPU\u5e73\u53f0\u9762\u4e34\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(N)\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u70b9\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u53ca\u6700\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8981\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914dGPU\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u534f\u8c03\u8005\u4e0e\u91cd\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f02\u6784\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u6beb\u79d2\u7ea7\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6ce2\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u56db\u4e2a\u5f02\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u9759\u6001\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548cGPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94GPU\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668GPU\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, localizing these faults to specific source files remains highly challenging due to the complexity and scale of modern compiler infrastructures. In this study, we propose MultiConf, a novel approach that automatically isolates compiler faults by constructing multiple pairs of adversarial compilation configurations. Each adversarial compilation configuration pair consists of a failing configuration and its corresponding passing configuration, which differ in only a small number of fine-grained options. MultiConf generates failing configurations through a lightweight construction process and derives the corresponding passing configurations by selectively disabling bug-related fine-grained options. We then employ a Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) formula to rank the suspiciousness of compiler source files. Each adversarial configuration pair independently produces a ranking, which is subsequently aggregated using a weighted voting scheme to derive a final suspiciousness ranking, enabling more accurate and robust fault localization. We evaluate MultiConf on a benchmark of 60 real-world GCC compiler bugs. The results demonstrate that MultiConf significantly outperforms existing compiler fault localization techniques in both effectiveness and efficiency. In particular, MultiConf successfully localizes 27 out of 60 bugs at the Top-1 file level, representing improvements of 35.0% and 28.6% over the two state-of-the-art approaches, Odfl(20) and Basic(21), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5MultiConf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7f16\u8bd1\u914d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9694\u79bb\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u6392\u540d\u53ef\u7591\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u3002\u572860\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9eGCC\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMultiConf\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMultiConf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u5efa\u591a\u5bf9\u4ec5\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9009\u9879\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u7f16\u8bd1\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5931\u8d25\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8c31\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d(SBFL)\u516c\u5f0f\u7ed9\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6e90\u6587\u4ef6\u6253\u5206\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u5bf9\u914d\u7f6e\u72ec\u7acb\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6848\u6c47\u603b\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u53ef\u7591\u5ea6\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b60\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cGCC\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668bug\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMultiConf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b\u5c24\u5176\u5728Top-1\u6587\u4ef6\u7ea7\u522b\u6210\u529f\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e8627\u4e2abug\uff0c\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5Odfl(20)\u548cBasic(21)\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8635.0%\u548c28.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMultiConf\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6545\u969c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6548\u7387\u786e\u5b9a\u5f15\u8d77\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6587\u4ef6\u3002"}}

LLMs provide generally reasonable suggestions, but often fail to generate optimal plans that account for detailed user requirements, given the vast number of potential POIs and possible routes based on POI combinations within a real-world road network. In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings. Subsequently, we propose an explore-and-bound paradigm to efficiently process KATR queries by eliminating redundant candidates based on estimated score bounds from global to local levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance over existing methods across different scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u611f\u77e5\u7684Top-k\u8def\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2(KATR)\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5305\u62ec\u5174\u8da3\u70b9(POI)\u8bbf\u95ee\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u65c5\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u7b97\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2a\u6027\u5316POI\u8bc4\u5206\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u9650\u5b9a\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406KATR\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u7684\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u6e38\u5ba2\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u624b\u52a8\u5730\u56fe\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cLLMs\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u5374\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8be6\u7ec6\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6700\u7b26\u5408\u7528\u6237\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u524dk\u6761\u6700\u4f73\u8def\u7ebf\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212API\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aKeyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR)\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u5404\u79cd\u7528\u6237\u7684\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u8bbf\u95ee\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u9884\u7b97\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u5316\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u8bc4\u5206\u7b49\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406KATR\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u9650\u5b9a\uff08explore-and-bound\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5f97\u5206\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KATR\u67e5\u8be2\u53ca\u5176\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u7684\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u8def\u7ebf\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u5177\u4f53\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u3002"}}

However, questions remain about their ability to repair unseen vulnerabilities. Our empirical study reveals that state-of-the-art models often overfit to the training set and are evaluated using training, validation, and test sets that are not mutually exclusive. Furthermore, relying on match-based metrics that compare generated patches to reference fixes at the token level has some limitations, failing to account for the possibility of various valid ways to patch the vulnerability. In this paper, we examine the capabilities of state-of-the-art fine-tuned AVR models and the adequacy of match-based evaluation metrics in three ways. First, we apply semantic-preserving transformations to test sets in order to determine whether models truly learn robust vulnerability-repair patterns or simply rely on spurious features. Second, we re-split the training, validation, and test sets to be mutually exclusive and evaluate the models on the revised test set to assess their generalization capabilities. Third, we introduce L-AVRBench, a test-based benchmark tailored for learning-based AVR, to overcome the limitations of match-based metrics and examine the AVR models' true repair capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d(AVR)\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u8f6c\u6362\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u5212\u5206\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6L-AVRBench\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4ef7AVR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8865\u4e01\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fee\u590d\u672a\u77e5\u6f0f\u6d1e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f0f\u6d1e\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\n2. \u91cd\u65b0\u5212\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b83\u4eec\u4e92\u65a5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n3. \u5f15\u5165L-AVRBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684AVR\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8003\u5bdfAVR\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AVR\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u73b0\u8c61\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u4f53\u73b0\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4f46\u540c\u6837\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6L-AVRBench\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u52a0\u5ba2\u89c2\u516c\u6b63\u5730\u8861\u91cfAVR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684AVR\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, the execution of these workflows still typically requires technical expertise in setting up calculation inputs, interpreting outputs, and handling the complexity of parallel code execution on remote machines. To address these challenges, the AiiDAlab platform was developed, making complex computational workflows accessible through an intuitive user interface that runs in a web browser. Here, we discuss how AiiDAlab has matured over the past few years, shifting its focus from computational materials science to become a powerful platform that accelerates scientific discovery across multiple disciplines. Thanks to its design, AiiDAlab allows scientists to focus on their research rather than on computational details and challenges, while keeping automatically track of the full simulation provenance via the underlying AiiDA engine and thus ensuring reproducibility. In particular, we discuss its adoption into quantum chemistry, atmospheric modeling, battery research, and even experimental data analysis at large-scale facilities, while also being actively used in educational settings. Driven by user feedback, significant effort has been made to simplify user onboarding, streamline access to computational resources, and provide robust mechanisms to work with large datasets. Furthermore, AiiDAlab is being integrated with electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), reinforcing adherence to the FAIR principles and supporting researchers in data-centric scientific disciplines in easily generating reproducible Open Research Data (ORD).", "AI": {"tldr": "AiiDAlab\u5e73\u53f0\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u80fd\u591f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u5e73\u53f0\u5df2\u7ecf\u4ece\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6b63\u5728\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\uff08ELN\uff09\u96c6\u6210\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\uff08ORD\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u65ad\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6765\u6267\u884c\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u8d85\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u6267\u884c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u89e3\u91ca\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u53ca\u5904\u7406\u8fdc\u7a0b\u673a\u5668\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u5907\u6280\u672f\u4e13\u957f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86AiiDAlab\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u7f51\u9875\u754c\u9762\u8bbf\u95ee\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "method": "AiiDAlab\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWeb\u7684\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u754c\u9762\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u5b66\u79d1\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u5e95\u5c42AiiDA\u5f15\u64ce\u81ea\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6574\u4e2a\u4eff\u771f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u73b0\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cAiiDAlab\u8fd8\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u65b0\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u63a5\u5165\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\uff0cAiiDAlab\u5f00\u59cb\u4e0e\u7535\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\uff08ELN\uff09\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u9075\u5faaFAIR\u539f\u5219\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u79d1\u7814\u4eba\u5458\u8f7b\u677e\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "AiiDAlab\u4e0d\u4ec5\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6750\u6599\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e5f\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u5927\u6c14\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u7814\u7a76\u4e43\u81f3\u5927\u578b\u79d1\u7814\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6709\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "AiiDAlab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fc3\u8fdb\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u4eec\u9762\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8ba1\u7b97\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u6280\u672f\u95e8\u69db\uff0c\u8ba9\u4ed6\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6838\u5fc3\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u62d3\u5c55\uff0cAiiDAlab\u6b63\u65e5\u76ca\u6210\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u79d1\u9886\u57df\u5185\u79d1\u7814\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

We present CFIghter, the first fully automated system that enables strict, type-based CFI in real-world projects by detecting, classifying, and repairing unintended policy violations exposed by the test suite. CFIghter integrates whole-program analysis with guided runtime monitoring and iteratively applies the minimal necessary adjustments to CFI enforcement only where required, stopping once all tests pass or remaining failures are deemed unresolvable. We evaluate CFIghter on four GNU projects. It resolves all visibility-related build errors and automatically repairs 95.8% of unintended CFI violations in the large, multi-library util-linux codebase, while retaining strict enforcement at over 89% of indirect control-flow sites. Across all subjects, CFIghter preserves strict type-based CFI for the majority of the codebase without requiring manual source-code changes, relying only on automatically generated visibility adjustments and localized enforcement scopes where necessary. These results show that automated compatibility repair makes strict compiler CFI practically deployable in mature, modular C software.", "AI": {"tldr": "CFIghter \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u4e2d\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u610f\u5916\u7b56\u7565\u8fdd\u89c4\u6765\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u542f\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff08CFI\uff09\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5168\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u5e76\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u5904\u8fed\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6216\u5269\u4f59\u5931\u8d25\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a GNU \u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cCFIghter \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e25\u683c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u578b CFI \u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u9760\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6267\u884c\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff08CFI\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u524d\u5411\u8fb9\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7531\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u975e\u9884\u671f\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578bC/C++\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "CFIghter \u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5168\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5f15\u5bfc\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u7531\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5957\u4ef6\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u610f\u5916CFI\u653f\u7b56\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u53ea\u5bf9\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u5e94\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u81f3CFI\u5b9e\u65bd\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u529f\u6216\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u8ba4\u5b9a\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2aGNU\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cCFIghter\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u6240\u6709\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u591a\u5e93util-linux\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u4e2d95.8%\u7684\u610f\u5916CFI\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8d85\u8fc789%\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\u800c\u8a00\uff0cCFIghter\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u4fee\u6539\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6267\u884c\u8303\u56f4\u4fdd\u7559\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c7b\u578b\u7684CFI\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u4fee\u590d\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668CFI\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6210\u719f\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316C\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBitFlipScope\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u7531\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u8001\u5316\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6545\u969c\u6240\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u5e72\u51c0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u6613\u53d7\u786c\u4ef6\u6545\u969c\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u7531\u786c\u4ef6\u9000\u5316\u3001\u5b87\u5b99\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u8bf8\u5982Rowhammer\u4e4b\u7c7b\u7684\u6545\u610f\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6545\u969c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6545\u969c\u4f1a\u65e0\u58f0\u5730\u7834\u574f\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u751a\u81f3\u5371\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u8bca\u65ad\u51fa\u52a3\u5316\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3001\u91c7\u53d6\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u63aa\u65bd\u6216\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u635f\u574f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86BitFlipScope\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u53d7\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cBitFlipScope\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5206\u6790\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u793a\u8150\u8d25\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6545\u969c\u3002\u5f53\u6ca1\u6709\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u5229\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\u6270\u52a8\u548c\u635f\u5931\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u53d7\u6545\u969c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u8bba\u5728\u54ea\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "BitFlipScope\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u671d\u5411\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6613\u635f\u53ca\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u503c\u5f97\u4fe1\u8d56\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5bb9\u9519\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

These bugs necessitate the research and practice of code optimization. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability. In recent years, machine learning and deep learning-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives by learning optimization heuristics from annotated code corpora and performance measurements. However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale. With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization. In this work, we proposed FasterPy, a low-cost and efficient framework that adapts LLMs to optimize the execution efficiency of Python code. FasterPy combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), supported by a knowledge base constructed from existing performance-improving code pairs and corresponding performance measurements, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enhance code optimization performance. Our experimental results on the Performance Improving Code Edits (PIE) benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing models on multiple metrics.

When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMatKV\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5b58\u50a8\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u5173\u952e-\u503c\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8RAG\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0eGPU\u4e0a\u7684\u5b8c\u5168KV\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMatKV\u80fd\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u5927\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMatKV\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5982\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u8f7d\u5df2\u7269\u5316\u7684KVs\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u7aefGPU\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1a\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u80fd\u8017\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u53d8\u5f97\u666e\u904d\u3002\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0cRAG\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u975e\u5e38\u8017\u80fd\u4e14\u8017\u65f6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8RAG\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MatKV\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97RAG\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u6587\u6863\uff09\u7684\u5173\u952e-\u503c\u5411\u91cf(KVs)\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7269\u8d28\u5316\u5230\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f46\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u95ea\u5b58\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91cd\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9bKVs\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u8017\u80fd\u7684GPU\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff0c\u4e0eGPU\u4e0a\u5b8c\u5168KV\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMatKV\u80fd\u591f\u5c06RAG\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u529f\u8017\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMatKV\u8fd8\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u4e00\u662fGPU\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u52a0\u8f7d\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u5df2\u7269\u5316KVs\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u7801\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u52a0\u8f7d\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u5bf9GPU\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8eKV\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4e00\u65e6\u5df2\u7269\u5316KVs\u88ab\u52a0\u8f7d\u5230GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u4f4e\u7aefGPU\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u800c\u4e0d\u4e25\u91cd\u727a\u7272\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "MatKV\u65b9\u6848\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8282\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

The implementation strategy is based on a portable programming model and the adoption of a memory pool manager that leverages the unified memory feature of modern GPUs. This approach is discussed alongside several numerical tests conducted on two pre-exascale clusters in Europe, LUMI and Leonardo, which host AMD MI250X and NVIDIA A100 GPUs, respectively.

In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to 6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSPER\uff08\u968f\u673a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cSPER\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347(3\u52306\u500d)\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u4ee3\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u9650\u5236\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SPER\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6392\u540d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u968f\u673a\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4ee3\u66ff\u5168\u5c40\u6392\u5e8f\uff0cSPER\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6311\u9009\u51fa\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u516b\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSPER\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u8fd1\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff083\u81f36\u500d\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SPER\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u901f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Conventional centralized processing architectures are increasingly unable to handle the volume and velocity of PMU data, particularly in modern grids with dynamic operating conditions. This paper presents a scalable cloud-native architecture for intelligent PMU data processing that integrates artificial intelligence with edge and cloud computing. The proposed framework employs distributed stream processing, containerized microservices, and elastic resource orchestration to enable low-latency ingestion, real-time anomaly detection, and advanced analytics. Machine learning models for time-series analysis are incorporated to enhance grid observability and predictive capabilities.

GenAI tools are being increasingly adopted by practitioners in SE, promising support for several SE activities. Despite increasing adoption, we still lack empirical evidence on how GenAI is used in practice, the benefits it provides, the challenges it introduces, and its broader organizational and societal implications. Objective. This study aims to provide an overview of the status of GenAI adoption in SE. It investigates the status of GenAI adoption, associated benefits and challenges, institutionalization of tools and techniques, and anticipated long term impacts on SE professionals and the community. Results. The results indicate a wide adoption of GenAI tools and how they are deeply integrated into daily SE work, particularly for implementation, verification and validation, personal assistance, and maintenance-related tasks. Practitioners report substantial benefits, most notably reduction in cycle time, quality improvements, enhanced support in knowledge work, and productivity gains. However, objective measurement of productivity and quality remains limited in practice. Significant challenges persist, including incorrect or unreliable outputs, prompt engineering difficulties, validation overhead, security and privacy concerns, and risks of overreliance. Institutionalization of tools and techniques seems to be common, but it varies considerably, with a strong focus on tool access and less emphasis on training and governance. Practitioners expect GenAI to redefine rather than replace their roles, while expressing moderate concern about job market contraction and skill shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6982\u8ff0GenAI\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08SE\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u91c7\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3001\u6311\u6218\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9SE\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u548c\u793e\u533a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGenAI\u5de5\u5177\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u65e5\u5e38SE\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u96be\u9898\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1GenAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u6b22\u8fce\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u9879\u6d3b\u52a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3001\u597d\u5904\u3001\u6311\u6218\u53ca\u5176\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3GenAI\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u597d\u5904\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u88ab\u5236\u5ea6\u5316\u7684\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0GenAI\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65e5\u5e38\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u786e\u8ba4\u3001\u4e2a\u4eba\u5e2e\u52a9\u53ca\u7ef4\u62a4\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u597d\u5904\uff0c\u5982\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u652f\u6301\u77e5\u8bc6\u5de5\u4f5c\u7b49\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u8bf8\u5982\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u96be\u5ea6\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5236\u5ea6\u5316\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57f9\u8bad\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u89c6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136GenAI\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u65b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9884\u8ba1GenAI\u5c06\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53d6\u4ee3\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c31\u4e1a\u5e02\u573a\u6536\u7f29\u548c\u6280\u672f\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002"}}

While recent efforts have validated their pre-training potential and accelerated inference speeds, the post-training landscape for dLLMs remains underdeveloped. Existing methods suffer from computational inefficiency and objective mismatches between training and inference, severely limiting performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics. To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data.

Ali Babar"], "title": "Securing the AI Supply Chain: What Can We Learn From Developer-Reported Security Issues and Solutions of AI Projects?", "comment": "Accepted at the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026) - Research Track", "summary": "The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models and applications has led to an increasingly complex security landscape. Developers of AI projects must contend not only with traditional software supply chain issues but also with novel, AI-specific security threats. However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Hugging Face\u548cGitHub\u4e0a\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9AI\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8c03\u67e5\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u7684distilBERT\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b312,868\u6761\u5b89\u5168\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f52\u7eb3\u51fa32\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u53ca24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u529e\u6cd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6f\u4ef6\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08AI\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u3002AI\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u9762\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u8981\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5\u77e5\u4e4b\u751a\u5c11\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e3aAI\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Hugging Face\u548cGitHub\u4e0a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6240\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8fdb\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u6765\u586b\u8865\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7a7a\u767d\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6700\u4f73\u5fae\u8c03\u7684distilBERT\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5b89\u5168\u76f8\u5173\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b312,868\u6b21\u5b89\u5168\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u4e86753\u7bc7\u5e16\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u9898\u5206\u6790\u540e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec32\u79cd\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u548c24\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5185\u5bb9\u88ab\u5f52\u7c7b\u5230\u56db\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7c7b\u522b\uff1a(1) \u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0e\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff1b(2) \u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b(3) \u6a21\u578b\uff1b(4) \u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u6e90\u4e8eAI\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u6d1e\u89c1\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u8d2f\u7a7f\u6574\u4e2aAI\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002"}}

This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMasters\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u5148\u63a9\u76d6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u975e\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u6062\u590d\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5c0f\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5e9e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f7f\u5f97\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u5236\u6559\u5e08\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "Masters\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u4e3b\u8981\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u853d\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u52a0\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u5730\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u90a3\u91cc\u5b66\u5230\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u84b8\u998f\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Masters\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u5386\u601d\u8003\u56de\u7b54\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e30\u5bcc\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8fbe\u5230\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Masters\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u5c0f\u578b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u540e\u8005\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, this method presents a critical trade-off: it improves throughput in low-load, memory-bound systems but degrades performance in high-load, compute-bound environments due to verification overhead. Current SD implementations use a fixed speculative length, failing to adapt to dynamic request rates and creating a significant performance bottleneck in real-world serving scenarios. To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit. Experiments show that Nightjar achieves up to 14.8% higher throughput and 20.2% lower latency compared to standard speculative decoding, demonstrating robust efficiency for real-time serving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNightjar\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u6d4b\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u8bf7\u6c42\u8d1f\u8f7d\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u63a8\u6d4b\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u65e0\u76ca\u65f6\u7981\u7528\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNightjar\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe14.8%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u548c20.2%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\uff08SD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5f00\u9500\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709SD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u6295\u673a\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u8bf7\u6c42\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u670d\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Nightjar\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6295\u673a\u6027\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u6574\u5230\u8bf7\u6c42\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f53\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u6ca1\u6709\u5e26\u6765\u597d\u5904\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u7981\u7528\u5b83\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cNightjar\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe14.8%\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u4ee5\u53ca20.2%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "Nightjar\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u6d4b\u957f\u5ea6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, production environments frequently experience Service Level Objective violations and cost inefficiencies due to reactive scaling behavior, limited use of application-level signals, and opaque control logic. This paper investigates how Kubernetes autoscaling can be enhanced using AIOps principles to jointly satisfy SLO and cost constraints under diverse workload patterns without compromising safety or operational transparency. We present a gap-driven analysis of existing autoscaling approaches and propose a safe and explainable multi-signal autoscaling framework that integrates SLO-aware and cost-conscious control with lightweight demand forecasting. Experimental evaluation using representative microservice and event-driven workloads shows that the proposed approach reduces SLO violation duration by up to 31 percent, improves scaling response time by 24 percent, and lowers infrastructure cost by 18 percent compared to default and tuned Kubernetes autoscaling baselines, while maintaining stable and auditable control behavior. These results demonstrate that AIOps-driven, SLO-first autoscaling can significantly improve the reliability, efficiency, and operational trustworthiness of Kubernetes-based cloud platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528AIOps\u539f\u5219\u6539\u8fdbKubernetes\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86SLO\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53ca\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u7684Kubernetes\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a31%\u7684SLO\u8fdd\u89c4\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u63d0\u9ad824%\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u964d\u4f4e18%\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u67b6\u6784\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7ea7\u522b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u670d\u52a1\u7ea7\u522b\u76ee\u6807\uff08SLO\uff09\u8fdd\u89c4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u95ee\u9898\u9891\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u8ddd\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u4fe1\u53f7\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86SLO\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eKubernetes\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ca\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11SLO\u8fdd\u89c4\u65f6\u957f\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u5c55\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u964d\u4f4e\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u5f00\u652f\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "AIOps\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4ee5SLO\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8eKubernetes\u4e91\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation.

However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay.\n  We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \\textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \\textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \\textit{Reconnect}. We replace static collective communication with dynamic, UCX-based (Unified Communication X) point-to-point communication, enabling immediate weight synchronization between recovered roles.

This growth is largely driven by the widespread migration of applications to the Cloud, alongside a rising number of users consuming digital content. Dynamic adaptation (or self-adaptive) approaches appear as a way to reduce, at runtime and under certain constraints, the energy consumption of software applications.\n  [Question/Problem] Despite efforts to make energy-efficiency a primary goal in the dynamic adaptation of software applications, there is still a gap in understanding how to equip these self-adaptive software systems (SAS), which are dynamically adapted at runtime, with effective energy consumption monitoring tools that enable energy-awareness. Furthermore, the extent to which such an energy consumption monitoring tool impacts the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem has not yet been thoroughly explored.\n  [Methodology] To address this gap, we introduce the EnCoMSAS (Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems) tool that allows to gather the energy consumed by distributed software applications deployed, for instance, in the Cloud. EnCoMSAS enables the evaluation of energy consumption of SAS variants at runtime. It allows to integrate energy-efficiency as a main goal in the analysis and execution of new adaptation plans for the SAS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of EnCoMSAS and investigate its impact on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem, we conduct an empirical study by using the Adaptable TeaStore case study. Adaptable TeaStore is a self-adaptive extension of the TeaStore application, a microservice benchmarking application. For this study, we focus on the recommender service of Adaptable TeaStore. Regarding the experiments, we first equip Adaptable TeaStore with EnCoMSAS. Next, we execute Adaptable TeaStore by varying workload conditions that simulate users interactions. Finally, we use EnCoMSAS for gathering and assessing the energy consumption of the recommender algorithms of Adaptable TeaStore. To run these experiments, we use nodes of the Grid5000 testbed.\n  [Results] The results show that EnCoMSAS is effective in collecting energy consumption of software applications for enabling dynamic adaptation at runtime. The observed correlation between CPU usage and energy consumption collected by EnCoMSAS provides evidence supporting the validity of the collected energy measurements. Moreover, we point out, through EnCoMSAS, that energy consumption is influenced not only by the algorithmic complexity but also by the characteristics of the deployment environment. Finally, the results show that the impact of EnCoMSAS on the overall energy consumption of the SAS ecosystem is comparatively modest with respect to the entire set of the TeaStore applications microservices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEnCoMSAS\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Adaptable TeaStore\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eEnCoMSAS\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6536\u96c6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6001\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5168\u7403\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8d39\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u8005\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5411\u4e91\u7aef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u52a0\u5267\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u7ecf\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u52aa\u529b\u5c06\u80fd\u6548\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u5907\u6709\u6548\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u76d1\u63a7\u5de5\u5177\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd9\u79cd\u76d1\u63a7\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6001\u73af\u5883\u603b\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86EnCoMSAS\uff08Energy Consumption Monitoring for Self-Adaptive Systems\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u90e8\u7f72\u4e8e\u4e91\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff09\u6240\u6d88\u8017\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30EnCoMSAS\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6001\u73af\u5883\u603b\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAdaptable TeaStore\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4f7fAdaptable TeaStore\u5177\u5907EnCoMSAS\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u8be5\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5229\u7528EnCoMSAS\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30Adaptable TeaStore\u63a8\u8350\u670d\u52a1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cEnCoMSAS\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u6536\u96c6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230CPU\u4f7f\u7528\u7387\u4e0eEnCoMSAS\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u6536\u96c6\u80fd\u91cf\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5916\uff0c\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u7279\u6027\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5173\u4e8eEnCoMSAS\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2aSAS\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eTeaStore\u5e94\u7528\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u5408\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u6bd4\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "EnCoMSAS\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u76d1\u6d4b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5b83\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u52a0\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8003\u8651\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001). At 90% specificity, Venkadesh21 showed lower sensitivity for Black (0.39, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.59) than White participants (0.69, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.73). These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB.

Unlike standard LLM post-training, agentic RL workloads are highly heterogeneous, combining compute-intensive prefill phases, bandwidth-bound decoding, and stateful, CPU-heavy environment simulations. We argue that efficient agentic RL training requires disaggregated infrastructure to leverage specialized, best-fit hardware. However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages.\n  We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\\(\\times\\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines. We also evaluate RollArc by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model for Qoder product on an Alibaba cluster with more than 3,000 GPUs, further demonstrating RollArc scalability and robustness.

However, these additions introduce a previously unexplored energy trade-off across modalities that remains poorly understood, as most prior work focuses on text-only models. In this paper, we examine modality inflation, a key source of inefficiency in which multimodal inputs increase inference workloads through extra encoding stages and expanded token sequences. We provide the first detailed, stage-level analysis of energy consumption in MLLM inference by breaking the pipeline into vision encoding, prefill, and decoding stages. Using four representative MLLMs evaluated on NVIDIA A100 GPU, we quantify the additional energy required for multimodal inference compared to text-only baselines, observing overheads ranging from 17% to 94% across models for identical inputs. Our results show that energy bottlenecks differ widely across model architectures, stemming either from compute-heavy vision encoders or from the downstream impact of large visual token sequences during prefill. By examining GPU power traces, we further uncover substantial GPU underutilization during multimodal execution and show that input complexity leads to markedly different energy scaling behaviors across models. Finally, we demonstrate that stage-wise dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is an effective optimization, allowing energy savings with only modest performance impact. Together, these findings offer practical insights and concrete guidance for designing more energy-efficient multimodal LLM serving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their reasoning often contains subtle logical errors masked by fluent language, posing significant risks for critical applications. While existing approaches like fact-checking, self-consistency methods, and rule-based validation provide partial solutions, they fail to detect complex logical flaws in multi-step reasoning.\n  To overcome these challenges, we present MATP, an evaluation framework for systematically verifying LLM reasoning via Multi-step Automatic Theorem Proving. MATP translates natural language reasoning into First-Order Logic (FOL) and applies automated theorem provers to assess step-by-step logical validity. This approach identifies hidden logical errors and provides fine-grained classifications of reasoning correctness. Evaluations on a benchmark comprising 10,830 reasoning instances generated by 10 LLMs across tasks from PrOntoQA-OOD, ProofWriter, and FOLIO show that MATP surpasses prompting-based baselines by over 42 percentage points in reasoning step verification. It further reveals model-level disparities, with reasoning models generating more logically coherent outputs than general models. These results demonstrate MATP's potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We evaluate our approach on both objective tasks (reasoning, mathematics, factuality, coding) and subjective human preference judgments. Our results demonstrate that probes achieve superior calibration compared to existing methods with $\\approx10$x computational savings, generalize robustly to unseen evaluation domains, and deliver higher accuracy on high-confidence predictions.

Existing RDMA transports, such as RoCE, IRN, SRNIC, and Falcon, enforce strict reliability and in-order delivery, relying on retransmissions and packet sequencing to ensure correctness. While these approaches work well for general-purpose workloads, they introduce complexity and latency that scale poorly in ML, where even rare packet delays can stall entire model pipelines.\n  We present OptiNIC, a domain-specific RDMA transport that revisits traditional reliability guarantees based on ML's tolerance for partial or missing data. OptiNIC eliminates retransmissions and in-order delivery from the NIC, enabling a best-effort, out-of-order transport model for RDMA. Unlike traditional RDMA, which signals completion only after complete data delivery, OptiNIC introduces adaptive timeouts to trigger forward progress when data may be lost or delayed. OptiNIC retains standard congestion control mechanisms (e.g., DCQCN, EQDS, or Swift) while shifting loss recovery to the ML pipeline itself (e.g., via the Hadamard Transform and Erasure Coding).\n  Our evaluation shows that OptiNIC improves time-to-accuracy (TTA) by 2x and increases throughput by 1.6x for training and inference, respectively, across two public clouds (i.e., Hyperstack and CloudLab).

The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method is suitable for the development of autonomous driving software, particularly in achieving real-time performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff08MBD\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5668\uff08MBP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5404\u79cd\u793e\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u4e4b\u4e00\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u5176\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9700\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u529f\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff08MBD\uff09\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5668\uff08MBP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u5408\u9002\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Existing solutions largely neglect the dynamic, stochastic, and heterogeneous nature of such environments, often ignoring the impact of variable output token lengths and device diversity. In this work, we present Argus, the first token-aware distributed edge-cloud LLM inference framework that conducts efficient task offloading. Argus features a Length-Aware Semantics (LAS) module, which predicts output token lengths for incoming prompts using a fine-tuned language model with token-length-sensitive feature modulation, enabling precise estimation. Building on this, our Lyapunov-guided Offloading Optimization (LOO) module formulates long-term Quality-of-Experience optimization that explicitly considers both LLM prefilling and decoding costs. We introduce a novel Iterative Offloading Algorithm with Damping and Congestion Control (IODCC) to effectively solve the resulting integer nonlinear programming problem under time-varying constraints. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate that Argus achieves robust performance and superior efficiency in highly dynamic, heterogeneous settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aArgus\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u8003\u8651\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91LLM\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7LAS\u6a21\u5757\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7LOO\u6a21\u5757\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5378\u8f7d\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u671f\u4f53\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5927\u591a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u968f\u673a\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u73af\u5883\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u53ef\u53d8\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bbe\u5907\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\uff08LAS\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u957f\u5ea6\uff1b\u4ee5\u53caLyapunov\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u4f18\u5316\uff08LOO\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u8d28\u91cf\u4f53\u9a8c\u4f18\u5316\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u8003\u8651\u4e86LLM\u9884\u586b\u5145\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u6210\u672c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u963b\u5c3c\u548c\u62e5\u585e\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5378\u8f7d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08IODCC\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u6574\u6570\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cArgus\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This has led to the adoption of software and hardware approaches such as Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 and multi-core processors. Traditional manual program parallelization faces challenges, including maintaining data integrity and avoiding concurrency issues such as deadlocks. While model-based development (MBD) automates this process, it encounters difficulties with the integration of modern frameworks such as ROS 2 in multi-input scenarios. This paper proposes an MBD framework to overcome these issues, categorizing ROS 2-compatible Simulink models into event-driven and timer-driven types for targeted parallelization. As a result, it extends the conventional parallelization by MBD and supports parallelized code generation for ROS 2-based models with multiple inputs.

We argue that implementations of this specification should be informed by key properties of self-adaptation: system-wide consistency (coordinated adaptations across replicas), planning (executing an adaptation until appropriate conditions are met),  and modularity (clean integration of adaptation logic).  In this implementation discussion paper, we examine how software architectural methods, the cloud-native Operator pattern, and legacy programming language techniques can decouple self-adaptive control logic from the TeaStore application. We analyze the trade-offs that these different approaches make between fine-grained expressive adaptation and system-wide control, and highlight when reuse of adaptation strategies is most effective. Our analysis suggests that these approaches are not mutually exclusive but can be combined into a multi-tiered architecture for self-adaptive microservices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4e91\u539f\u751fOperator\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0TeaStore\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3aAdaptable TeaStore\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e94\u8be5\u8003\u8651\u5230\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\uff1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u8de8\u526f\u672c\u534f\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\uff09\u3001\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u6267\u884c\u9002\u5e94\u76f4\u5230\u6ee1\u8db3\u9002\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u5757\u5316\uff08\u5e72\u51c0\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u9002\u5e94\u903b\u8f91\uff09\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65bd\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u4e91\u539f\u751fOperator\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0TeaStore\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u975e\u76f8\u4e92\u6392\u65a5\u800c\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7ec4\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u91cd\u7528\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u7efc\u5408\u8fd0\u7528\u8f6f\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4e91\u539f\u751f\u6280\u672f\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u6280\u5de7\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u642d\u914d\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u590d\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff08TVS\uff09\u4e0e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u5272\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff08TVS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7LLM\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u6587\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n2. \u5229\u7528LLM\u5224\u65ad\u8fde\u7eed\u5e27\u662f\u5426\u63cf\u7ed8\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u6001\u90bb\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n3. \u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6574\u5408\u4e86TVS\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e27\u4e0e\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u90bb\u5c45\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u4f3c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u3002\n4. \u6839\u636e\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6bcf\u5e27\u4e0e\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u3002\n5. \u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u542f\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5206\u5272\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u6001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Includes appendices", "summary": "Consistent hashing is fundamental to distributed systems, but ring-based schemes can exhibit high peak-to-average load ratios unless they use many virtual nodes, while multi-probe methods improve balance at the cost of scattered memory accesses. This paper introduces Local Rendezvous Hashing (LRH), which preserves a token ring but restricts Highest Random Weight (HRW) selection to a cache-local window of C distinct neighboring physical nodes. LRH locates a key by one binary search, enumerates exactly C distinct candidates using precomputed next-distinct offsets, and chooses the HRW winner (optionally weighted). Lookup cost is O(log|R| + C). Under fixed-topology liveness changes, fixed-candidate filtering remaps only keys whose original winner is down, yielding zero excess churn. In a benchmark with N=5000, V=256 (|R|=1.28M), K=50M and C=8, LRH reduces Max/Avg load from 1.2785 to 1.0947 and achieves 60.05 Mkeys/s, about 6.8x faster than multi-probe consistent hashing with 8 probes (8.80 Mkeys/s) while approaching its balance (Max/Avg 1.0697).

Optimization of resource allocation configuration parameters for CPU and memory during the Release phase remains a largely unexplored problem as most research has focused on intelligent scheduling and autoscaling of microservices during the Ops stage of the DevOps cycle. Yet horizontal auto-scaling of containers, based on CPU usage for instance, may still leave these containers with an inappropriately allocated amount of memory, if no upfront fine-tuning of both resources is applied before the Deployment phase. We evaluate the performance optimization framework using the TeaStore microservice application and statistically compare different optimization algorithms, supporting informed decisions about their trade-offs between sampling cost and distance to the optimal resource configuration. This shows that upfront factor screening, for reducing the search space, is helpful when the goal is to find the optimal resource configuration with an affordable sampling budget. When the goal is to statistically compare different algorithms, screening must also be applied to make data collection of all data points in the search space feasible.  If the goal is to find a near-optimal configuration, however, it is better to run bayesian optimization without screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5728DevOps\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u7684CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7TeaStore\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8bc4\u4f30\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u8ba1\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9884\u5148\u7b5b\u9009\u56e0\u5b50\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\uff1b\u800c\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u7b5b\u9009\u76f4\u63a5\u8fd0\u884c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u5408\u9002\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982CPU\u548c\u5185\u5b58\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8fd0\u7ef4\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eCPU\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5bb9\u5668\u6c34\u5e73\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u5f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9664\u975e\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u8d44\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7ec6\u81f4\u8c03\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TeaStore\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u65f6\uff0c\u63d0\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u7d20\u7b5b\u9009\u662f\u6709\u76ca\u7684\uff1b\u5982\u679c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5219\u5fc5\u987b\u5b9e\u65bd\u7b5b\u9009\u4ee5\u4f7f\u6536\u96c6\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\uff1b\u82e5\u5bfb\u6c42\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5219\u5efa\u8bae\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u65e0\u7b5b\u9009\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u5fae\u670d\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u53d1\u5e03\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u914d\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5f53\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4bPCI\u672f\u540e\u5fc3\u810f\u6b7b\u4ea1\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a5\u53d7PCI\u6cbb\u7597\u60a3\u8005\u957f\u671f\u9884\u540e\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5fc3\u810f\u6b7b\u4ea1\uff09\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e862044\u540d\u63a5\u53d7PCI\u6cbb\u7597\u5206\u53c9\u75c5\u53d8\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e09\u5e74\u540e\u7684\u6b7b\u4ea1\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86500\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u3002\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u79fb\u9664\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u7279\u5f81\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387(0.92-0.93)\uff0c\u4f46\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u589e\u52a0\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86AUROC\u503c\u3002\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u5c04\u8840\u5206\u6570\u3001\u5916\u5468\u52a8\u8109\u75be\u75c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u75be\u75c5\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u8868\u683c\u8bb0\u5f55\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5e38\u89c4\u62a5\u544a\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u53ca\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

Source code available at: https://github.com/Reckonchamp12/physics-constraint-paradox", "summary": "Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u5149\u6805\u8026\u5408\u5668\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5197\u4f59\u6027\u548cFabry-Perot\u632f\u8361\u5bf9\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6807\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u6dfb\u52a0\u6d41\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u7269\u7406\u8d1f\u5438\u6536\u503c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u9002\u5f53\u79fb\u9664\u67d0\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u533a\u5206\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u7ec4\u4ef6\u662f\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5149\u6805\u8026\u5408\u5668\u8c31\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4e94\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5230100\u70b9\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u53bb\u9664\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5f3a\u5236\u3001Fabry-Perot\u632f\u8361\u3001\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u7b49\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6096\u8bba\uff1a\u5f53\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u7a0b\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5f3a\u5236\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u662f\u591a\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u6709\u65e0\u6b64\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7248\u672c\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a7\u00d710^-9\uff09\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\u5730\uff0c\u53bb\u9664Fabry-Perot\u632f\u8361\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u534a\u6700\u5927\u5e26\u5bbd\u6269\u6563\uff08\u4ece132.3 nm\u964d\u81f337.4 nm\uff09\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8672%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u52a0\u566a\u518d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u4f1a\u5f15\u51650.5%\u7684\u975e\u7269\u7406\u8d1f\u5438\u6536\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982Fabry-Perot\u632f\u8361\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5e26\u5bbd\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Code available at https://github.com/varshith-Git/Valori-Kernel", "summary": "Modern AI systems rely on vector embeddings stored and searched using floating-point arithmetic. While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine. Valori guarantees bit-identical memory states, snapshots, and search results across platforms.

However, reproducibility remains limited due to unreported variability in base-film morphology (crystallinity, grain orientation, free volume), which governs monomer diffusion, radical distribution, and the Trommsdorff effect, leading to spatial graft gradients and performance inconsistencies. We present a hierarchical stacking optimization framework with a Dirichlet's Process (SoDip), a hierarchical data-driven framework integrating: (1) a decoder-only Transformer (DeepSeek-R1) to encode textual process descriptors (irradiation source, grafting type, substrate manufacturer); (2) TabNet and XGBoost for modelling multimodal feature interactions; (3) Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMM) for uncertainty quantification and heteroscedasticity; and (4) Bayesian Optimization for efficient exploration of high-dimensional synthesis space. A diverse dataset was curated using ChemDataExtractor 2.0 and WebPlotDigitizer, incorporating numerical and textual variables across hundreds of RIG studies. In cross-validation, SoDip achieved ~33% improvement over GPR while providing calibrated confidence intervals that identify low-reproducibility regimes. Its stacked architecture integrates sparse textual and numerical inputs of varying quality, outperforming prior models and establishing a foundation for reproducible, morphology-aware design in graft polymerization research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u5806\u53e0\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6SoDip\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8f90\u5c04\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63a5\u679d(RIG)\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u57fa\u819c\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5904\u7406\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8RIG\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f90\u5c04\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63a5\u679d(RIG)\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5236\u5907\u79bb\u5b50\u4ea4\u6362\u819c\u3001CO2\u5206\u79bb\u819c\u548c\u7535\u6c60\u7535\u89e3\u8d28\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u518d\u73b0\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u57fa\u819c\u5f62\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u800c\u53d7\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f62\u6001\u4e0a\u7684\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u5f71\u54cd\u5355\u4f53\u6269\u6563\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u57fa\u5206\u5e03\u53caTrommsdorff\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9020\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a5\u679d\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSoDip\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5806\u53e0\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\uff1a(1)\u4f7f\u7528DeepSeek-R1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u4ec5\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u6587\u672c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff1b(2)\u91c7\u7528TabNet\u548cXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b(3)\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\uff08GPR\uff09\u4e0e\u72c4\u5229\u514b\u96f7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b(DPMM)\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff1b(4)\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5408\u6210\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6570\u767e\u4e2aRIG\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SoDip\u76f8\u6bd4GPR\u6709\u7ea633%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u518d\u73b0\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5176\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5141\u8bb8\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6587\u672c\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SoDip\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u91cd\u73b0\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u679d\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, graph data often exhibits overlap among different clients. Previous research has demonstrated certain benefits of overlapping data in mitigating data heterogeneity. However, the negative effects have not been explored, particularly in cases where the overlaps are imbalanced across clients. In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function.

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u7fa4\u805a\u5408GAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7535\u5668\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u7535\u5668\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u914d\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u652f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7535\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u7535\u5668\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Cluster Aggregated GAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7535\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u88ab\u5206\u7ec4\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff1b\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7535\u5668\u5219\u9075\u5faa\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528LSTM\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6355\u6349\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8861\u91cf\u73b0\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\u805a\u5408GAN\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8d1f\u8f7d\u76d1\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8d1f\u8f7d\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable. Methodologically, the paper shows how Double Machine Learning can be used to estimate conditional indirect effects in organizational research without forcing the data into a linear shape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u627f\u62c5\u7ba1\u7406\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u5b58\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9464\u540d\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5458\u5de5\u798f\u7949\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u8bfb\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u505a\u6cd5\u4e0e\u7ee9\u6548\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\u3002\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u76d1\u7ba1\u900f\u660e\u5e76\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u624d\u4f1a\u518d\u6b21\u52a0\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8865\u6551\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5f3a\u76d1\u7ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5f3a\u5236\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u627f\u62c5\u7ba1\u7406\u804c\u8d23\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u672c\u7684\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u80fd\u5426\u7ee7\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5458\u5de5\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8c03\u8282\u4e2d\u4ecb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u65bd\u52a0\u9650\u5236\u6027\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e464\u540d\u96f6\u5de5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u660e\u663e\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u652f\u6301\u6027\u4eba\u529b\u8d44\u6e90\u5b9e\u8df5\u867d\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5458\u5de5\u798f\u5229\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8868\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u76d1\u7ba1\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0d\u6e05\u65f6\u4f1a\u51cf\u5f31\uff1b\u5f53\u76d1\u7ba1\u53d8\u5f97\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u540e\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u53c8\u4f1a\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u8bfb\u5b9e\u9645\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e73\u53f0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u90e8\u5206\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u4e71\uff0c\u800c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u52a0\u4e0a\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u8ffd\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u5219\u80fd\u4f7f\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u4ece\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u95f4\u63a5\u6548\u5e94\u800c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u5f3a\u8feb\u6570\u636e\u7b26\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely.

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u6846\u67b6LLMBoost\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3001\u94fe\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u4e09\u5927\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b97\u672f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53ea\u7ed3\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LLMBoost\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u6765\u6253\u7834\u8fd9\u79cd\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "LLMBoost\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1) \u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5141\u8bb8\u540e\u7eed\u6a21\u578b\u8bbf\u95ee\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u524d\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2) \u94fe\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u91c7\u7528\u9519\u8bef\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u9010\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3) \u8fd1\u4f3c\u5e76\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c42\u95f4\u7ba1\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u63a5\u8fd1\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u6548\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7ea0\u6b63\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u987a\u5e8f\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7b97\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cLLMBoost\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5229\u7528LLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\uff0cLLMBoost\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold.\n  We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural.\n  We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u4e50\u89c2\u53ef\u884c\u641c\u7d22\uff08OFS\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e26\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u4fdd\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u53e3\u5e73\u7b49\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u9650\u5236\u3002OFS\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e50\u89c2\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOFS\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u534a\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076bandit\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7d2f\u79ef\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u8d37\u6b3e\u3001\u7b5b\u9009\u6216\u518d\u72af\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u53cd\u9988\u6548\u5e94\uff1a\u51b3\u7b56\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u975e\u7a33\u6001\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u53e3\u5e73\u7b49\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u9009\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e50\u89c2\u53ef\u884c\u641c\u7d22(Optimistic Feasible Search, OFS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u7ef4\u6301\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u9608\u503c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u53ca\u7ea6\u675f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u3002\u6bcf\u8f6e\u4e2d\uff0cOFS\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u636e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u770b\u4f3c\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u80fd\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e50\u89c2\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u9608\u503c\u770b\u4f3c\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u5219\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e50\u89c2\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u9608\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u7c7b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "OFS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728(i)\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u7f29\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u4fdd\u7b56\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c(ii)\u4ee5\u5fb7\u56fd\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u548cCOMPAS\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u534a\u5408\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u4fdd\u7b56\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cOFS\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u539f\u59cb-\u5bf9\u5076bandit\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c0f\u7d2f\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u626b\u63cf\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u53ef\u884c\u56fa\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e50\u89c2\u53ef\u884c\u641c\u7d22(OFS)\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u53e3\u5e73\u7b49\u53ca\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7ef4\u9608\u503c\u7b56\u7565\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aOFS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u76ca\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u89c4\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone.

This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6765\u81ea18\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684\u5168\u7403M2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528TimeXer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08TimeXer-Exog\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5305\u62ecLSTM\u3001N-BEATS\u7b49\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u671f\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u572870\u5929\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u5176\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u5355\u53d8\u91cfTimeXer\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc789%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5176\u6781\u7aef\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u800c\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u957f\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u5185\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5168\u7403\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4f53\u7684M2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u670912\u5468\u6ede\u540e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9886\u5148\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u540d\u4e3aTimeXer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff08TimeXer-Exog\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5305\u62ecLSTM\u3001N-BEATS\u3001PatchTST\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u5355\u53d8\u91cfTimeXer\u5728\u5185\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u4ece2020\u5e741\u6708\u81f32025\u5e748\u6708\u7684\u6bcf\u65e5\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u572870\u5929\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TimeXer-Exog\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e861.08e8\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee(MSE)\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u53d8\u91cfTimeXer\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc789%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b8f\u89c2\u7ecf\u6d4e\u72b6\u51b5\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5168\u7403M2\u6d41\u52a8\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u8003\u8651\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c3d\u7ba1LoRA\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4fee\u6539\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51e0\u4e4e\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4f7f\u7528\u5982LoRA\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578bKL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u60e9\u7f5a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u627f\u62c5\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6781\u5927\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u751a\u81f3\u6d88\u9664\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002"}}

CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates.\n  Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCRC\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u81ea\u6211\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53d8\u91cf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eCRC\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u7684\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ea0\u6b63\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fee\u6b63\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u8bef\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "CRC\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6821\u6b63\u5668\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u6b8b\u5dee\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u56db\u91cd\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCRC\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "CRC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u4ee3\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u9884\u62a5\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6821\u6b63\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

This paper develops AMBIT, a gray-box framework that augments physical mobility baselines with interpretable tree models. We begin with a comprehensive audit of classical spatial interaction models on a year-long, hourly NYC taxi OD dataset. The audit shows that most physical models are fragile at this temporal resolution; PPML gravity is the strongest physical baseline, while constrained variants improve when calibrated on full OD margins but remain notably weaker. We then build residual learners on top of physical baselines using gradient-boosted trees and SHAP analysis, demonstrating that (i) physics-grounded residuals approach the accuracy of a strong tree-based predictor while retaining interpretable structure, and (ii) POI-anchored residuals are consistently competitive and most robust under spatial generalization.

To bridge this gap, this study proposes a collaborative optimization Boosting model of multiclass imbalanced learning. This model is simple but effective by integrating the density factor and the confidence factor, this study designs a noise-resistant weight update mechanism and a dynamic sampling strategy. Rather than functioning as independent components, these modules are tightly integrated to orchestrate weight updates, sample region partitioning, and region-guided sampling. Thus, this study achieves the collaborative optimization of imbalanced learning and model training.

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata.

However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down.\n  We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices.\n  To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6392\u540d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u7ec4\u6210\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u5fae\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u5fae\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u6392\u540d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e25\u683c\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6784\u6210\u53d8\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u5c0f\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6e90\u81ea\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u7acb\u4e00\u5957\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6240\u5fc5\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u6392\u540d\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5355\u8c03\u4e14Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u7b26\u5408\u6240\u63d0\u516c\u7406\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u6392\u540d\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u5355\u8c03\u53c8Lipschitz\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u6620\u5c04\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6e05\u6670\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b58\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u677e\u5f1b\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5f00\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u7acb\u5173\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u516c\u7406\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u9c81\u68d2\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81eaNHTSA\u76842500\u591a\u6761\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AV\uff09\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u6210\u56e0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6c7d\u8f66\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u89c4\u6a21\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u4ee5\u52a0\u5dde\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540cSAE\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u8d8b\u52bf\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4e8b\u6545\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u5c06\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\u5206\u4e3a4\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u5e94\u7528\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398(ARM)\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7167\u660e\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u8def\u9762\u72b6\u51b5\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u7b49\u4e0e\u4e8b\u6545\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u884c\u4e3a\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u8054\u89c4\u5219\u6316\u6398\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u6545\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u4e92\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5f00\u53d1\u5546\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u7ba1\u673a\u6784\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEnFlow\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEnFlow\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6784\u8c61\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5219\u53ea\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u793a\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6784\u8c61\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "EnFlow\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08FM\uff09\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6cbf\u975e\u9ad8\u65afFM\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u80fd\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bfc\u5411\u66f4\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6784\u8c61\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728GEOM-QM9\u548cGEOM-Drugs\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEnFlow\u4ec5\u75281-2\u6b65ODE\u5373\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "conclusion": "EnFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u80fd\u91cf\u6784\u8c61\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u6001\u6784\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5373\u538b\u7f29\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u9988\uff08CAFe\uff09\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u9988\uff08CAFe-S\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7740\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5e26\u5bbd\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u504f\u7f6e\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u538b\u7f29\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u9988\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fb5\u72af\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1. \u538b\u7f29\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u9988\uff08Compressed Aggregate Feedback, CAFe\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u4e00\u8f6e\u5168\u5c40\u805a\u5408\u66f4\u65b0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b2. \u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u9988\uff08Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback, CAFe-S\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u62e5\u6709\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u79c1\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u5019\u9009\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u5145\u5f53\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(DGD)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u8868\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u5b9a\u53ca\u6709\u754c\u68af\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cCAFe\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u504f\u7f6e\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u538b\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(DCGD)\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0cCAFe-S\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u70b9\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5b9e\u9645\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CAFe\u548cCAFe-S\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5b58\u50a8\u4efb\u4f55\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2a\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u5373\u53ef\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the large quantity of newly proposed architectures, together with often contradictory empirical results, makes it difficult to assess which components contribute significantly to final performance. We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures.

Results reveal a striking dichotomy: MTL significantly degrades regression performance (resistivity $R^2$: 0.897 $\\to$ 0.844; hardness $R^2$: 0.832 $\\to$ 0.694, $p < 0.01$) but improves classification (amorphous F1: 0.703 $\\to$ 0.744, $p < 0.05$; recall +17%).

Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk.

A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($\u03bc$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $\u03bc$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u6a21\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u6709\u7528\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u6765\u8bf4\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7387\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5bbd\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5bbd\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5b9e\u9645\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u5f97\u5f02\u5e38\u6602\u8d35\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u627e\u5230\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e14\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63a8\u7406\u8de8\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5f53\u7531\u8fc1\u79fb\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u6d88\u5931\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u6709\u9650\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u66f4\u5feb\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u8be5\u8fc1\u79fb\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528Maximal Update Parameterization\uff08\u03bcP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8fc1\u79fb\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5219\u4e0d\u7136\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f51\u683c\u641c\u7d22\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u6709\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u662f\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u610f\u4e49\u4e0a\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u6574\u66f4\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u7b56\u7565\u80cc\u540e\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u6a21\u611f\u77e5\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u8f83\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u8f83\u5927\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

The system is defined by three tightly coupled components: (1) a {time-independent wave-energy solver} that treats perception and classification as spectral decomposition under a learned Hamiltonian; (2) a {time-dependent dynamical solver} governing the evolution of semantic wavefunctions over time, enabling context-aware decision revision, re-routing, and reasoning under environmental changes; and (3) a {low-rank operator calculus} that learns symbolic transformations such as modular arithmetic through learned quantum-like transition operators. Together, these components form a coherent physics-driven alternative to conventional cross-entropy training and transformer attention, providing robust generalization, interpretable semantics, and emergent topology.\n  Empirically, Schr\u00f6dinger AI demonstrates: (a) emergent semantic manifolds that reflect human-conceived class relations without explicit supervision; (b) dynamic reasoning that adapts to changing environments, including maze navigation with real-time potential-field perturbations; and (c) exact operator generalization on modular arithmetic tasks, where the system learns group actions and composes them across sequences far beyond training length. These results suggest a new foundational direction for machine learning, where learning is cast as discovering and navigating an underlying semantic energy landscape.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Schr\u00f6dinger AI\uff0c\u5b83\u7531\u4e09\u4e2a\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u51fa\u73b0\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSchr\u00f6dinger AI\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u6ce2\u80fd\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\uff1b\u4f4e\u79e9\u7b97\u5b50\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7c7b\u4f3c\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u6267\u884c\u7b26\u53f7\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "result": "Schr\u00f6dinger AI\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u53cd\u6620\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u5174\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u6a21\u7b97\u672f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8d85\u8bad\u7ec3\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cbe\u786e\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSchr\u00f6dinger AI\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u628a\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5bfc\u822a\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering.

Rabiee"], "title": "ReDiF: Reinforced Distillation for Few Step Diffusion", "comment": null, "summary": "Distillation addresses the slow sampling problem in diffusion models by creating models with smaller size or fewer steps that approximate the behavior of high-step teachers. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning based distillation framework for diffusion models. Instead of relying on fixed reconstruction or consistency losses, we treat the distillation process as a policy optimization problem, where the student is trained using a reward signal derived from alignment with the teacher's outputs. This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements.

This paper presents our preliminary study on Mixture-of-Representations (MoR), a novel, per-tensor and sub-tensor level quantization framework that dynamically analyzes a tensor's numerical properties to select between a variety of different representations. Based on the framework, we have proposed and experimented concrete algorithms that choose dynamically between FP8 and BF16 representations for both per-tensor and sub-tensor level granularities. Our universal approach is designed to preserve model quality across various quantization partition strategies and datasets. Our initial findings show that this approach can achieve state-of-the-art results with 98.38% of tensors quantized to the FP8 format. This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6MoR\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7279\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f20\u91cf\u6216\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9FP8\u548cBF16\u8868\u793a\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9ad8\u8fbe98.38%\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aFP8\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u6269\u5c55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u6210\u529f\u8fdb\u884c\u6df7\u5408\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f20\u91cf\u53ca\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u914d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aMixture-of-Representations (MoR) \u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f20\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u5b50\u5f20\u91cf\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362FP8\u4e0eBF16\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e1a\u754c\u9886\u5148\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d98.38%\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u91cf\u5316\u6210FP8\u683c\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684FP8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u666e\u904d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u66f4\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6570\u683c\u5f0f\uff08\u5982NVFP4\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7531\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u201c\u6559\u5e08\u201d\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u201c\u5b66\u751f\u201d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u957f\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86S2S\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8868\u660eAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u505a\u957f\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e00\u6b65\u751f\u6210\u957f\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6311\u6218\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u84b8\u998f\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528Deep Learning Earth System Model\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc710,000\u5e74\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u84b8\u998f\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u6c14\u5019\u5b66\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u5176\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7ERA5\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0eECMWF\u96c6\u5408\u9884\u62a5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684S2S\u9884\u62a5\u6280\u5de7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u7531AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u671f\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, uniform goal selection often results in sample inefficiency in multi-goal settings where agents must learn a universal goal-conditioned policy. Inspired by the adaptive and structured learning processes observed in biological systems, we propose a novel Student-Teacher learning paradigm with a Temporal Variance-Driven Curriculum to accelerate Goal-Conditioned RL. In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks. The results show consistent and notable improvements over state-of-the-art curriculum learning and goal-selection methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u751f-\u6559\u5e08\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7b56\u7565\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5206\u6570\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6301\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u751f-\u6559\u5e08\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f-\u6559\u5e08\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u5757\u6839\u636e\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u503c\uff08Q\uff09\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709RL\u6846\u67b6\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf911\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u52a0\u901f\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees.\n  First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms.\n  Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms.\n  Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f6c\u4ecb\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u53ca\u5176\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5e26\u6709\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u56de\u5f52\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u529b\u91cf\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f6c\u4ea4\u7ed9\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u7b80\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u5bfc\u5411\u66f4\u5c0f\u3001\u7cbe\u7b80\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f6c\u4ecb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e26\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u4ecb\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u60c5\u51b5\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u548c\u9884\u6d4b-\u62d2\u7edd\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6b64\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f6c\u4ecb\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u53ca\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u60c5\u51b5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u5e26\u8f6c\u4ecb\u7684\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u6210\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e26\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CIFAR-100\u548cSVHN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f6c\u4ecb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u5f3aH-\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u6210\u672c\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5e26\u8f6c\u4ecb\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u9762\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8f6c\u4ecb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data.

We propose Multiple Token Divergence (MTD), a simple measure of computational effort defined as the KL divergence between a model's full output distribution and that of a shallow, auxiliary prediction head. MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones.

This study focuses on single-channel electroencephalography (EEG), a practical and widely available signal for automatic sleep staging. Existing approaches face challenges such as class imbalance, limited receptive-field modeling, and insufficient interpretability. This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets. These results indicate that the proposed approach effectively improves sleep staging performance while maintaining interpretability and suitability for real-world clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5355\u901a\u9053EEG\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8N1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728SleepEDF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u738789.72%\u53ca\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u657085.46%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9N1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8661.7%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7761\u7720\u969c\u788d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u6210\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5065\u5eb7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5355\u901a\u9053\u8111\u7535\u56fe\uff08EEG\uff09\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u800c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u5982\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u6709\u9650\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cN1\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u901a\u9053EEG\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728N1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u3002EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u6210\u5b50\u65f6\u6bb5\u5757\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5404\u5757softmax\u6982\u7387\u53d6\u5e73\u5747\u503c\u5f97\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u5728SleepEDF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8689.72%\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c85.46%\u7684\u5b8f\u89c2\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684N1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5176F1\u5206\u6570\u66f4\u662f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8661.7%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Multimodal Complexity Is Not All You Need", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning architectures for multimodal learning have increased in complexity, driven by the assumption that multimodal-specific methods improve performance. We challenge this assumption through a large-scale empirical study reimplementing 19 high-impact methods under standardized conditions, evaluating them across nine diverse datasets with up to 23 modalities, and testing their generalizability to new tasks beyond their original scope, including settings with missing modalities. We propose a Simple Baseline for Multimodal Learning (SimBaMM), a straightforward late-fusion Transformer architecture, and demonstrate that under standardized experimental conditions with rigorous hyperparameter tuning of all methods, more complex architectures do not reliably outperform SimBaMM. Statistical analysis indicates that more complex methods perform comparably to SimBaMM and frequently do not reliably outperform well-tuned unimodal baselines, especially in the small-data regime considered in many original studies.

Current Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) continual learning techniques often retain and freeze previously learned LoRAs or generate data representations to overcome forgetting, typically utilizing these to support new LoRAs learn new tasks. However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling.

This paper investigates the canonical FedAvg algorithm through the lens of Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) to diagnose this failure mode. We hypothesize that the aggregation of conflicting client updates leads to circuit collapse, the destructive interference of functional, sparse sub-networks responsible for specific class predictions. By training inherently interpretable, weight-sparse neural networks within an FL framework, we identify and track these circuits across clients and communication rounds. Using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to quantify circuit preservation, we provide the first mechanistic evidence that Non-IID data distributions cause structurally distinct local circuits to diverge, leading to their degradation in the global model.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch. These results show that PI-MFM provides a practical and scalable path toward data-efficient, transferable PDE solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses.\n  To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses.\n  Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u6765\u6392\u9664\u6781\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7cbe\u786e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u53c2\u6570\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u8bcd\u6c47\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0d\u662f\u4e8b\u540e\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u76f4\u63a5\u7ea6\u675fRL\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u526a\u540e\u7684\u201c\u5b89\u5168\u201d\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u6392\u9664\u4e86\u6781\u7aef\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u6982\u7387\u975e\u5e38\u4f4e\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u8f83\u5c0f\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u66ff\u6362\u4e86\u5927\u4e14\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bcd\u6c47\u4fee\u526a\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Uniform Convergence Bounds for Generative & Vision-Language Models under Low-Dimensional Structure", "comment": "13 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low.\n  We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees.\n  Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u533b\u5b66\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e73\u6ed1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3Lipschitz\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cVLM\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u5e73\u5747\u6821\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u7565\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9002\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6240\u6709\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u4e0a\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u4e00\u81f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\u72b6\u51b5\u6216\u7279\u5b9a\u7fa4\u4f53\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5373\u4f7f\u603b\u4f53\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u8f83\u5927\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u53d7\u9650\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u65cf\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u548c\u8054\u5408\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6536\u655b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u9762\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\u5728\u5173\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u7684Lipschitz\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cVLM\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5185\u5728/\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u73af\u5883\u5d4c\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e0e\u8c31\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u8870\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e73\u5747\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u67b6\u6784\uff08SE-MLP\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u7a7f\u900f\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5de5\u7a0b\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u7a7f\u900f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7a7f\u900f\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5468\u671f\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6324\u538b\u4e0e\u6fc0\u52b1\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08SE-MLP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u52a0\u901f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u7a7f\u900f\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfMLP\u3001XGBoost\u53caTransformer\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSE-MLP\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u901a\u9053\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u6062\u590d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5bb9\u8bb8\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SE-MLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a7f\u900f\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u7a7f\u900f\u5f15\u4fe1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8df5\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios. This study provides a dedicated dataset, a baseline model, and establishes a foundation for future WSL research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u659c\u53ca\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u51b5\u7684PDVFN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\uff08WSL\uff09\u5728\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u666e\u904d\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u63a9\u76d6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u53d8\u5f97\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e5f\u5e38\u5728\u4e8e\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b13,158\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u6837\u672c\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5411\u91cf+\u65f6\u9891\u56fe\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPDVFN\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u4e13\u4e3a\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002PDVFN\u80fd\u591f\u5e76\u884c\u62bd\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u9891\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9075\u5faa\u5c40\u90e8\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6291\u5236\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6355\u6349\u3001\u9891\u7387\u63d0\u53d6\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u539f\u5219\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f31\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u53ca\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684WSL\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5929\u6587\u5b66\u5149\u8c31\u5b66\u7b49WSL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite extensive research on representation learning, decentralized approaches remain relatively underexplored. This work develops a decentralized projected gradient descent-based algorithm for multi-task representation learning. We focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression in which multiple linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation. We present an alternating projected gradient descent and minimization algorithm for recovering a low-rank feature matrix in a diffusion-based decentralized and federated fashion.

In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of over 12 PEFT methodologies across the DeepSeek-R1-Distill families on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results challenge the default adoption of standard LoRA with three main findings. First, we demonstrate that structural variants, such as DoRA, AdaLoRA, and MiSS, consistently outperform LoRA. Second, we uncover a spectral collapse phenomenon in SVD-informed initialization strategies (\\textit{e.g.,} PiSSA, MiLoRA), attributing their failure to a fundamental misalignment between principal-component updates and RL optimization.

The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $\u03a9(d^\u03c9)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $\u03c9\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^\u03c9T)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/\u03b5)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $\u03b5$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{\u03c9+1}/\u03b5)$.\n  This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^\u03c9\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/\u03b5)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLightONS\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u6cd5(ONS)\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebfeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316(OXO)\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002LightONS\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18$O(d \\log T)$\u9057\u61be\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u603b\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u5230$O(d^2 T + d^\\omega\\sqrt{T \\log T})$\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u4e3a\u968f\u673aeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316(SXO)\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a$\\tilde{O}(d^3/\\varepsilon)$\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86COLT'13\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebfeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\uff08OXO\uff09\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6807\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5728\u7ebf\u725b\u987f\u6b65\uff08ONS\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u9a6c\u6c0f\u6295\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6574\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230$\\tilde{O}(d^\\omega T)$\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fed\u4ee3\u9891\u7e41\u63a5\u8fd1\u57df\u8fb9\u754c\u65f6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u968f\u673aeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\uff08SXO\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ONS\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u5230\u6279\u91cf\u8f6c\u6362\u6765\u90e8\u7f72\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8f83\u957f\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u725b\u987f\u6b65\u6cd5\u7248\u672c\u2014\u2014LightONS\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6ede\u540e\u673a\u5236\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u9a6c\u6c0f\u6295\u5f71\u76f4\u5230\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u523b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u81f3$O(d^2 T + d^\\omega\\sqrt{T \\log T})$\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86$O(d \\log T)$\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u9057\u61be\u7387\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6539\u8fdb\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u81ea\u7531\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u6362\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLightONS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f5c\u4e3aONS\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f46\u4e0d\u9650\u4e8e\u9057\u61be\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u8303\u6570\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9057\u61be\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u968f\u673a\u591a\u81c2\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b83\u8fd8\u6210\u529f\u5730\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u7531Koren [2013]\u5728COLT'13\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u5bfb\u627e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4e\u4e8e$\\tilde{O}(d^{\\omega+1}/\\varepsilon)$\u7684SXO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165LightONS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5728\u7ebfeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u968f\u673aeXp-\u51f9\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection\" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u7269\u7406-\u51e0\u4f55\u64cd\u4f5c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08PGOT\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0cPGOT\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7f29\u51cf\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u53e0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PGOT\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u6765\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u201c\u7269\u7406\u5207\u7247-\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u5165\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6O(N)\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u660e\u786e\u4fdd\u5b58\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5750\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u81f3\u4f4e\u9636\u7ebf\u6027\u6216\u9ad8\u9636\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "PGOT\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u6c7d\u8f66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u610f\u8bc6\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f7f\u7528Transformers\u8fdb\u884cPDE\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5904\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer.

However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9a\u5f8b\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6781\u9650\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8d8b\u52bf\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u9650\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u534f\u4f5c\u6536\u76ca\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e00LLM\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u90fd\u662f\u6709\u9650\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u5176\u96c6\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u201c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9a\u5f8b\u201d\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6c47\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u9884\u7b97\u9884\u6d4bLLM\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u9650\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8a00\u673a\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9884\u8a00\u673a\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u7684\u603b\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u4e2d\u4efb\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u635f\u5931\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u603b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9075\u5faa\u5e42\u5f8b\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u7f29\u653e\u800c\u8a00\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6539\u5584\u8d8b\u52bf\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u635f\u5931\u5e95\u7ebf\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u6bd4\u8d77\u540c\u4e00\u5bb6\u65cf\u5185\u90e8\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5408\u4f5c\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u6269\u5927LLMs\u667a\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer.

While these CoT modes enhance reasoning capabilities, their generation of extended reasoning traces introduces substantial memory and latency overheads, posing challenges for practical deployment on Ascend NPUs. This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy. These findings collectively indicate that low-bit quantization effectively facilitates efficient CoT reasoning on Ascend NPUs, maintaining high model fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u534e\u4e3a\u7684openPangu-Embedded\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u5728Ascend NPUs\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548Chain-of-Thought\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u5728Ascend NPUs\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7531\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684Chain-of-Thought\uff08CoT\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f00\u9500\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f4e\u4f4d\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301INT8 (W8A8) \u548c W4A8 \u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9Atlas A2\u4e0a\u7684openPangu-Embedded\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "INT8\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4e09\u79cdCoT\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u8fc790%\u7684FP16\u57fa\u7ebf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728Atlas A2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.5\u500d\u7684\u9884\u586b\u5145\u52a0\u901f\uff1bW4A8\u867d\u7136\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6709\u4e00\u5b9a\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e3aAscend NPUs\u4e0a\u5f00\u653ePangu\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548CoT\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8f83\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

In this context, methods developed for the non-blind case cannot be adapted in a straightforward manner. Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through illustrative numerical experiments that confirm the predicted convergence behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08LMMSEs\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u76f2\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0eTikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b49\u4ef7\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u6240\u5b66\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f2\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u524d\u5411\u7b97\u5b50\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u975e\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5982\u6210\u50cf\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668(LMMSE)\u7b80\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f97\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u89e3\u3001\u4e0e\u9002\u5f53\u9009\u53d6\u7684Tikhonov\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u5efa\u7acb\u7b49\u4ef7\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u6e90\u6761\u4ef6\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u7528\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u9519\u8bef\u754c\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u9650\u660e\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u7b97\u5b50\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6d88\u5931\u65f6\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u76f2\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LMMSE\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Code is available in https://github.com/EmreTaha/STAMP", "summary": "Temporally aware image representations are crucial for capturing disease progression in 3D volumes of longitudinal medical datasets. However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSTAMP\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Masked Autoencoding (MAE)\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528STAMP\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ec4\u6591\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982Masked Autoencoding (MAE)\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7eb5\u5411\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STAMP\uff08Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cdSiamese MAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u8f93\u5165\u4f53\u79ef\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u3002STAMP\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06MAE\u91cd\u5efa\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2aOCT\u548c\u4e00\u4e2aMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86STAMP\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u6bcf\u4f4d\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u591a\u6b21\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528STAMP\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e74\u9f84\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ec4\u6591\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684MAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "STAMP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4ece\u7eb5\u5411\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u75be\u75c5\u7684\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u75be\u75c5\u8fdb\u5c55\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We propose Dynamic Subspace Composition (DSC), a framework that approximates context-dependent weights via a state-dependent, sparse expansion of a shared basis bank. Formally, DSC models the weight update as a residual trajectory within a Star- Shaped Domain, employing a Magnitude-Gated Simplex Interpolation to ensure continuity at the identity. Unlike standard Mixture-of-LoRAs, which incurs O(M rd) parameter complexity by retrieving independent rank-r matrices, DSC constructs a compositional rank-K approximation from decoupled unit-norm basis vectors. This reduces parameter complexity to O(M d) and memory traffic to O(Kd), while Frame-Theoretic regularization and spectral constraints provide rigorous worst-case bounds on the dynamic update.

However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}.

Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5FRoD\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u7b4920\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFRoD\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281.72%\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u6355\u6349\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6240\u9700\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FRoD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5c42\u6b21\u8054\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u65cb\u8f6c\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u5171\u4eab\u57fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\u6ce8\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5168\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "FRoD\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u768420\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8c03\u65741.72%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FRoD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift.

Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a reliable source for emotion recognition due to its high temporal resolution and its direct reflection of neural activity. Nevertheless, variations across recording sessions present a major challenge for model generalization. To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEGDA\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301EEG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5728SEED-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEGDA\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14Gamma\u9891\u6bb5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e2d\u592e\u9876\u53f6\u548c\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u8111\u533a\u88ab\u8ba4\u5b9a\u4e3a\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5f55\u4f1a\u8bdd\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5dee\u5f02\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EGDA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5bf9\u9f50\u5168\u5c40\uff08\u8fb9\u7f18\uff09\u548c\u7c7b\u7279\u5b9a\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\uff09\u5206\u5e03\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301EEG\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "EGDA\u5728SEED-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8681.22%\u300180.15%\u548c83.27%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aGamma\u9891\u7387\u5e26\u662f\u6700\u5177\u533a\u5206\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e2d\u592e\u9876\u53f6\u548c\u524d\u989d\u53f6\u5927\u8111\u533a\u57df\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "EGDA\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u8de8\u4f1a\u8bdd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eEEG\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86Gamma\u9891\u6bb5\u53ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u5927\u8111\u533a\u57df\u5728\u60c5\u7eea\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

The benchmark is grounded in raw inference and scoring logs from VLMs and constructs quality and cost matrices over sample-model pairs. In scale, VL-RouterBench covers 14 datasets across 3 task groups, totaling 30,540 samples, and includes 15 open-source models and 2 API models, yielding 519,180 sample-model pairs and a total input-output token volume of 34,494,977. The evaluation protocol jointly measures average accuracy, average cost, and throughput, and builds a ranking score from the harmonic mean of normalized cost and accuracy to enable comparison across router configurations and cost budgets. On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure.

Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u590d\u6742\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236\uff08SPC\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d28\u91cf\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u8fdd\u53cd\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u63a7\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u589e\u5f3aSPC\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff1a\u4fdd\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u56fe\u548c\u4fdd\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u63a7\u3002\u524d\u8005\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u542f\u7528\u5982'\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5cf0\u503c'\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u540e\u8005\u5219\u5c06\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f4\u89c2p\u503c\u56fe\u8868\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e3a\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019].\n  We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $\u03b4(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLe Cam\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165Le Cam\u5931\u771f\uff08\u7531\u7f3a\u9677\u8ddd\u79bb\u03b4(E1, E2)\u91cf\u5316\uff09\u6765\u66ff\u4ee3\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u4e94\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94(UDA)\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u4f7f\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u8868\u793a\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u4e24\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f15\u8d77\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u2018\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u2019\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLe Cam\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6784\u9020\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6cd5\u53d6\u4ee3\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u8f6c\u800c\u8ffd\u6c42\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u53ef\u6a21\u62df\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Le Cam\u5931\u771f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fc1\u79fb\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u4e0a\u9650\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u6e90\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6838\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6e90\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5305\u62ecHLA\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u3001CIFAR-10\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cLe Cam\u5931\u771f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u5728HLA\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u5b66\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5730\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e86\u9891\u7387\uff1b\u4e8eCIFAR-10\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8681.2%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u4e0b\u964d\u5230\u4e8634.7%\uff1b\u5728RL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u91cc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5374\u906d\u9047\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "conclusion": "Le Cam Distortion\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u51fa\u73b0\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u3002"}}

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u5927\u91cf\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408\u6240\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u9690\u542b\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u6587\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8f85\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5236\u5b9a\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u53ca\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002\n2. \u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u51bb\u7ed3\u526f\u672c\u5145\u5f53\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5219\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u5668-\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u5584\u3002\n3. \u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u5c55\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u957f\u8fbe225\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684Qwen3-30B-A3B\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u521d\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8670%\u4e13\u5bb6\u504f\u597d\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u4e1484%\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002\n2. \u5f53\u5c06\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u65b0\u7684arXiv\u9884\u5370\u672c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e8612%-22%\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\n3. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6267\u884c\u53cd\u9988\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u533b\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\uff09\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u901a\u7528AI\u534f\u540c\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}
