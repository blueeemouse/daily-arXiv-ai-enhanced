Abstract: The quality of experience (QoE) delivered by video conferencing systems is
significantly influenced by accurately estimating the time-varying available
bandwidth between the sender and receiver. Bandwidth estimation for real-time
communications remains an open challenge due to rapidly evolving network
architectures, increasingly complex protocol stacks, and the difficulty of
defining QoE metrics that reliably improve user experience. In this work, we
propose a deployed, human-in-the-loop, data-driven framework for bandwidth
estimation to address these challenges. Our approach begins with training
objective QoE reward models derived from subjective user evaluations to measure
audio and video quality in real-time video conferencing systems. Subsequently,
we collect roughly $1$M network traces with objective QoE rewards from
real-world Microsoft Teams calls to curate a bandwidth estimation training
dataset. We then introduce a novel distributional offline reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm to train a neural-network-based bandwidth estimator
aimed at improving QoE for users. Our real-world A/B test demonstrates that the
proposed approach reduces the subjective poor call ratio by $11.41\%$ compared
to the baseline bandwidth estimator. Furthermore, the proposed offline RL
algorithm is benchmarked on D4RL tasks to demonstrate its generalization beyond
bandwidth estimation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is pivotal in drug
discovery. However, existing approaches often fail to capture deep intra-modal
feature interactions or achieve effective cross-modal alignment, limiting
predictive performance and generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose M3ST-DTI, a multi-task learning model that enables multi-stage
integration and alignment of multi modal features for DTI prediction. M3ST-DTI
incorporates three types of features-textual, structural, and functional and
enhances intra-modal representations using self-attention mechanisms and a
hybrid pooling graph attention module. For early-stage feature alignment and
fusion, the model in tegrates MCA with Gram loss as a structural constraint. In
the later stage, a BCA module captures fine-grained interactions between drugs
and targets within each modality, while a deep orthogonal fusion module
mitigates feature redundancy.Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that M3ST-DTI consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods
across diverse metrics

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text--image retrieval is necessary for applications such as product
recommendation. Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient
large-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily
trained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture
abstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation
applications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast,
state-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in
a flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly
handling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills
the preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system,
transferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the
inference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on
persona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an
efficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of scientific literature, scholars increasingly
demand precise and high-quality paper recommendations. Among various
recommendation methodologies, graph-based approaches have garnered attention by
effectively exploiting the structural characteristics inherent in scholarly
networks. However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic
influence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph
representations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the
Mutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a
gravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between
scholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process
during message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the
model utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual
embeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent
embeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the
heterogeneous scholarly network. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world
datasets demonstrate that the MIARec model outperforms baseline models across
three primary evaluation metrics, indicating its effectiveness in scientific
paper recommendation tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally
shifted recommender systems from discriminative to generative paradigms, where
user behavior modeling is achieved by generating target items conditioned on
historical interactions. Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from
two core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the
reliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder
negatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However,
applying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique
generation space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine
sampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive
identical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced
Preference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based
paradigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in
generative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve
sampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based
accuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe
consistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking
performance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance
across both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly
across different backbone families and scales. Beyond empirical gains, we
systematically investigate the design space of RLVR in recommendation across
generation, sampling strategy, reward modeling, and optimization algorithm,
offering insights for future research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have recently achieved remarkable progress
in video question answering (VideoQA) by jointly processing visual, textual,
and audio information. However, it remains unclear which video representations
are most effective for MLLMs, and how different modalities balance task
accuracy against computational efficiency. In this work, we present a
comprehensive empirical study of video representation methods for VideoQA with
MLLMs. We systematically evaluate single modality inputs question only,
subtitles, visual frames, and audio signals as well as multimodal combinations,
on two widely used benchmarks: VideoMME and LongVideoBench. Our results show
that visual frames substantially enhance accuracy but impose heavy costs in GPU
memory and inference latency, while subtitles provide a lightweight yet
effective alternative, particularly for long videos. These findings highlight
clear trade-offs between effectiveness and efficiency and provide practical
insights for designing resource-aware MLLM-based VideoQA systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multimodal recommender systems enhance personalized recommendations in
e-commerce and online advertising by integrating visual, textual, and user-item
interaction data. However, existing methods often overlook two critical biases:
(i) modal confounding, where latent factors (e.g., brand style or product
category) simultaneously drive multiple modalities and influence user
preference, leading to spurious feature-preference associations; (ii)
interaction bias, where genuine user preferences are mixed with noise from
exposure effects and accidental clicks. To address these challenges, we propose
a Causal-inspired multimodal Recommendation framework. Specifically, we
introduce a dual-channel cross-modal diffusion module to identify hidden modal
confounders, utilize back-door adjustment with hierarchical matching and
vector-quantized codebooks to block confounding paths, and apply front-door
adjustment combined with causal topology reconstruction to build a deconfounded
causal subgraph. Extensive experiments on three real-world e-commerce datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines while maintaining strong interpretability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a
single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual
vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on
the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a
simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this
setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from
replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative
feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU
blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the
design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that
better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance
of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the
original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing
average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2
NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual
parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this
empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled
intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation
studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform
the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming
our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across
random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT
models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent progress in language and vision foundation models demonstrates the
importance of discrete token interfaces that transform complex inputs into
compact sequences for large-scale modeling. Extending this paradigm to graphs
requires a tokenization scheme that handles non-Euclidean structures and
multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Existing approaches to graph
tokenization, linearized, continuous, and quantized, remain limited in
adaptability and efficiency. In particular, most current quantization-based
tokenizers organize hierarchical information in fixed or task-agnostic ways,
which may either over-represent or under-utilize structural cues, and lack the
ability to dynamically reweight contributions from different levels without
retraining the encoder. This work presents a hierarchical quantization
framework that introduces a self-weighted mechanism for task-adaptive
aggregation across multiple scales. The proposed method maintains a frozen
encoder while modulating information flow through a lightweight gating process,
enabling parameter-efficient adaptation to diverse downstream tasks.
Experiments on benchmark datasets for node classification and link prediction
demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines under comparable
computational budgets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In recent years, various approaches have been proposed to leverage large
language models (LLMs) for incorporating textual information about items into
recommender systems. Existing methods primarily focus on either fine-tuning
LLMs to generate recommendations or integrating LLM-based embeddings into
downstream models. In this work, we follow the latter direction and propose
\textbf{TextGCN}, which applies parameter-free graph convolution layers
directly over LLM-based item-title embeddings, instead of learning ID-based
embeddings as in traditional methods. By combining language semantics with
graph message passing, this architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, significantly outperforming prior approaches. Furthermore, we
introduce \textbf{TextGCN-MLP}, which extends TextGCN with a trainable
multilayer perceptron trained using a contrastive loss, achieving
state-of-the-art in-domain performance on recommendation benchmarks. However,
the zero-shot performance of TextGCN-MLP remains lower than that of TextGCN,
highlighting the trade-off between in-domain specialization and zero-shot
generalization. We release our code on github at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric
retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters
(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during
inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric
level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is
more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document
interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric
injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic
study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that
parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,
and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction
at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level
document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents
within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual
documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and
become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either
source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents
and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric
representations to advance PRAG.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.
