Abstract: Medical AI systems face catastrophic forgetting when deployed in clinical settings, where models must learn new imaging protocols while retaining prior diagnostic capabilities. This challenge is particularly acute for medical vision-language models that must preserve complex cross-modal alignments between medical images and clinical terminology across diverse imaging modalities. We introduce Prompt- Aware Adaptive Elastic Weight Consolidation (PA-EWC), a novel continual learning approach that addresses catastrophic forgetting through prompt-guided parameter specialization. Our method systematically categorizes model parameters based on their functional roles in processing visual-descriptive, spatial-guided, and medical-semantic information, enabling targeted protection of critical knowledge while allowing adaptation to new clinical requirements. PA-EWC incorporates adaptive Fisher Information computation with gradient stability analysis and develops weighted complexity metrics based on medical terminology density. We evaluate our approach across five medical imaging datasets (Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2018, CheXlocalize, BUSI, CAMUS) representing diverse modalities including endoscopy, dermoscopy, radiography, and ultrasound. Experimental results demonstrate that PA-EWC reduces catastrophic forgetting by up to 17.58% compared to baseline methods, with performance improvements of 4.30% on chest X-ray pathology localization and 6.06% on polyp segmentation.

TL;DR: AV-Edit：一种基于视觉、音频和文本语义的生成式音效编辑框架，能够对视频中的现有音频进行细粒度编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音效编辑方法仅依赖低级信号处理或粗略文本提示，导致灵活性有限、音频质量欠佳

Method: 使用对比视听掩码自编码器（CAV-MAE-Edit）进行多模态预训练，然后训练基于相关特征门控训练策略的多模态扩散变压器（MM-DiT）

Result: 实验表明AV-Edit能够基于视觉内容生成具有精确修改的高质量音频

Conclusion: AV-Edit在音效编辑领域实现了最先进的性能，在音频生成领域展现出强大竞争力

Abstract: Sound effect editing-modifying audio by adding, removing, or replacing elements-remains constrained by existing approaches that rely solely on low-level signal processing or coarse text prompts, often resulting in limited flexibility and suboptimal audio quality. To address this, we propose AV-Edit, a generative sound effect editing framework that enables fine-grained editing of existing audio tracks in videos by jointly leveraging visual, audio, and text semantics. Specifically, the proposed method employs a specially designed contrastive audio-visual masking autoencoder (CAV-MAE-Edit) for multimodal pre-training, learning aligned cross-modal representations. These representations are then used to train an editorial Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) capable of removing visually irrelevant sounds and generating missing audio elements consistent with video content through a correlation-based feature gating training strategy. Furthermore, we construct a dedicated video-based sound editing dataset as an evaluation benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed AV-Edit generates high-quality audio with precise modifications based on visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the field of sound effect editing and exhibiting strong competitiveness in the domain of audio generation.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 提出一种新的散布图可视化抽象方法，重点关注中低密度区域的特征保留，通过三步流程实现更好的特征保存效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模散布图中过度绘制不可避免，现有方法在中低密度区域容易丢失重要特征

Method: 1. 将散布图划分为等密度区域并均衡视觉密度 2. 为每个区域内不同类别分配像素 3. 基于像素重建数据分布

Result: 用户研究、定量和定性评估表明，相比先前方法，本方法能更好地保留特征，在处理超高动态范围数据分布时具有特殊优势

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模散布图提供了跨任意抽象级别的更好特征保持，特别是在中低密度区域表现出色

Abstract: Overdraw is inevitable in large-scale scatterplots. Current scatterplot abstraction methods lose features in medium-to-low density regions. We propose a visual abstraction method designed to provide better feature preservation across arbitrary abstraction levels for large-scale scatterplots, particularly in medium-to-low density regions. The method consists of three closely interconnected steps: first, we partition the scatterplot into iso-density regions and equalize visual density; then, we allocate pixels for different classes within each region; finally, we reconstruct the data distribution based on pixels. User studies, quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that, compared to previous methods, our approach better preserves features and exhibits a special advantage when handling ultra-high dynamic range data distributions.

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), generative engines are becoming powerful alternatives to traditional search, reshaping retrieval tasks. In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a "universally effective" GEO strategy. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO.

### [5] [Generating Querying Code from Text for Multi-Modal Electronic Health Record](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20904)
*Mengliang ZHang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TQGen数据集和TQGen-EHRQuery框架，旨在通过自然语言生成查询来改进电子健康记录系统的信息检索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含大量结构化和非结构化数据，但复杂的数据表关系和专业术语限制了查询准确性，增加了临床医生的工作负担。

Method: 构建TQGen数据集，集成表格和临床文本；提出TQGen-EHRQuery框架，包含医学知识模块和问题模板匹配模块；引入工具集概念封装文本处理模块。

Result: 通过大量实验验证了数据集和工作流程的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了提升EHR系统信息查询能力的潜力。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain extensive structured and unstructured data, including tabular information and free-text clinical notes. Querying relevant patient information often requires complex database operations, increasing the workload for clinicians. However, complex table relationships and professional terminology in EHRs limit the query accuracy. In this work, we construct a publicly available dataset, TQGen, that integrates both \textbf{T}ables and clinical \textbf{T}ext for natural language-to-query \textbf{Gen}eration. To address the challenges posed by complex medical terminology and diverse types of questions in EHRs, we propose TQGen-EHRQuery, a framework comprising a medical knowledge module and a questions template matching module. For processing medical text, we introduced the concept of a toolset, which encapsulates the text processing module as a callable tool, thereby improving processing efficiency and flexibility. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our dataset and workflow, demonstrating their potential to enhance information querying in EHR systems.

Abstract: Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.

TL;DR: FITRep是一种基于注意力机制的白箱商品表征框架，解决了多模态嵌入中的局部结构塌陷问题，在美团广告系统上实现了CTR和CPM的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将多模态表征视为黑箱，忽略了商品元素间的结构关系（如主次元素），导致局部结构塌陷问题，影响商品去重效果。

Method: 提出FITRep框架：1) CHIE模块用MLLMs提取层次化语义概念；2) SPDR模块基于UMAP进行结构保持的降维；3) FBC模块基于FAISS实现高效聚类。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示，FITRep在美团广告系统上带来CTR提升3.60%，CPM提升4.25%。

Conclusion: FITRep通过引入注意力机制和结构感知的表征学习，有效解决了商品去重中的结构塌陷问题，具有实际商业价值。

Abstract: Online platforms usually suffer from user experience degradation due to near-duplicate items with similar visuals and text. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.

TL;DR: RIA框架：统一的端到端排序-重排序架构，通过四个核心模块实现高效的推荐系统优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将排序和重排序解耦，导致组合稀疏性和表示能力受限

Method: 提出RIA框架，包含UCDT、CUHT、LMH和EC四个模块，实现排序和重排序的深度融合

Result: 在公开和工业数据集上超越SOTA模型，AUC和LogLoss显著提升

Conclusion: RIA框架成功解决了排序-重排序解耦问题，在实际部署中带来显著的CTR和CPM提升

Abstract: Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.
