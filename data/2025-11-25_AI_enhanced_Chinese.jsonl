However, a significant gap remains: current re-rankers often lack mechanisms for fine-grained user control. They struggle to balance inherent user preferences with multiple attribute-based constraints, often resorting to simplistic hard filtering that can excessively narrow the recommendation pool and yield suboptimal results. This limitation leaves users as passive recipients rather than active collaborators in the recommendation process. To bridge this gap, we propose COREC, a novel token-augmented re-ranking framework that incorporates specific user requirements in co-creating the recommendation outcome. COREC empowers users to steer re-ranking results with precise and flexible control via explicit, attribute-based signals. The framework learns to balance these commands against latent preferences, yielding rankings that adhere to user instructions without sacrificing personalization. Experiments show that COREC: (1) exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on standard recommendation effectiveness and (2) demonstrates superior adherence to specific attribute requirements, proving that COREC enables fine-grained and predictable manipulation of the rankings.", "AI": {"tldr": "COREC \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u4e0e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u4e8e\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "COREC \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u8ba9\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u63a8\u8350\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5171\u521b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u5e73\u8861\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCOREC \u5728\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "COREC \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u9700\u6c42\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

A key indicator of retention is revisitation, i.e., when users return to view previously saved content, a behavior often sparked by personalized recommendations and user satisfaction. However, modeling and optimizing revisitation poses significant challenges. One core difficulty is accurate attribution: it is often unclear which specific user actions or content exposures trigger a revisit, since many confounding factors (e.g., content quality, user interface, notifications, or even changing user intent) can influence return behavior. Additionally, the scale and timing of revisitations introduce further complexity; users may revisit content days or even weeks after their initial interaction, requiring the system to maintain and associate extensive historical records across millions of users and sessions. These complexities render existing methods insufficient for robustly capturing and optimizing long-term revisitation. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel, lightweight, and interpretable framework for modeling revisitation behavior and optimizing long-term user retention in Pinterest's search-based recommendation context. By defining a surrogate attribution process that links saves to subsequent revisitations, we reduce noise in the causal relationship between user actions and return visits. Our scalable event aggregation pipeline enables large-scale analysis of user revisitation patterns and enhances the ranking system's ability to surface items with high retention value.

Further analysis indicates that the main limitation of current VLMs is their inability to maintain cross-level state, rather than a lack of taxonomic knowledge. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose Self-Elicited Knowledge Distillation (SEKD), which requires no human labels or external tools: the same VLM is prompted to reason step by step and act as a teacher by exposing its hard labels, soft distributions, and decoder hidden states, while a single-pass student distills these signals. The student VLM remains efficient while approaching the accuracy of its multi-step teacher.

Moreover, most struggle to address biased user behaviors (e.g., accidental clicks, fast skips), leading to inaccurate interest modeling and frequent negative feedback in top recommendations with unclear causes. To tackle this issue, we collect real-world user video-watching sequences, annotate the reasons for users' dislikes, and construct a benchmark dataset for personalized explanations. We then introduce the Agentic Explainable Negative Feedback (ENF) framework, which integrates three core components: (1) the Profile Agent, extracting behavioral cues from users' historical data to derive psychological and personality profiles; (2) the Video Agent, performing comprehensive multimodal video analysis; and (3) the Reason Agent, synthesizing information from the other two agents to predict user engagement and generate explanations. Additionally, we propose the S-GRPO algorithm, enabling the model to progressively address complex tasks during reinforcement fine-tuning. Experimental results on the collected dataset show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in negative feedback prediction and reason explanation.

Therefore, it is of great importance to develop an effective and generalizable method for multi-modal deepfake detection. Typically, the audio-visual correlation learning could expose subtle cross-modal inconsistencies, e.g., audio-visual misalignment, which serve as crucial clues in deepfake detection. In this paper, we reformulate the correlation learning with variational Bayesian estimation, where audio-visual correlation is approximated as a Gaussian distributed latent variable, and thus develop a novel framework for deepfake detection, i.e., Forgery-aware Audio-Visual Adaptation with Variational Bayes (FoVB). Specifically, given the prior knowledge of pre-trained backbones, we adopt two core designs to estimate audio-visual correlations effectively. First, we exploit various difference convolutions and a high-pass filter to discern local and global forgery traces from both modalities. Second, with the extracted forgery-aware features, we estimate the latent Gaussian variable of audio-visual correlation via variational Bayes. Then, we factorize the variable into modality-specific and correlation-specific ones with orthogonality constraint, allowing them to better learn intra-modal and cross-modal forgery traces with less entanglement.

Traditional graph neural network algorithms often fail because they learn spurious environmental correlations instead of stable causal relationships, leading to substantial performance degradation under distribution shifts. While recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue due to their vast world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, effectively integrating this knowledge with the fine-grained topology of specific graphs to solve the OOD problem remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we propose {$\\textbf{Inv}$ariant $\\textbf{G}$raph $\\textbf{C}$ontrastive Learning with $\\textbf{LLM}$s for Out-of-Distribution Recommendation (InvGCLLM)}, an innovative causal learning framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of data-driven models and knowledge-driven LLMs. Our framework first employs a data-driven invariant learning model to generate causal confidence scores for each user-item interaction. These scores then guide an LLM to perform targeted graph refinement, leveraging its world knowledge to prune spurious connections and augment missing causal links. Finally, the structurally purified graphs provide robust supervision for a causality-guided contrastive learning objective, enabling the model to learn representations that are resilient to spurious correlations.

However, this approach introduces item-side unfairness. Existing studies primarily attribute this issue to the absence of fairness constraints during SFT and attempt to mitigate unfairness via re-weighting and re-ranking methods. In this paper, we find that unfairness arises not only from SFT but also from pre-training, where inherent biases are further amplified during SFT. This finding underscores the failure of current methods to address the root causes of unfairness. Moreover, current methods struggle to preserve satisfactory recommendation performance. To tackle these issues, we propose an Unfair-to-Fair evOlving (UFO) framework using a self-play mechanism, formulating unfairness mitigation as a two-player game. UFO alternates between two player roles: the \\textit{judger}, which identifies unfairness from both pre-training and SFT, and the \\textit{corrector}, which adjusts the LRS to address identified unfairness while preserving recommendation performance. Iterative optimization between these roles enables UFO to completely resolve unfairness.

However, existing methods often overlook two critical factors: irregular user interests between interactions and highly uneven item distributions over time. The former factor implies that actual user preferences are not always continuous, and long-term historical interactions may not be relevant to current purchasing behavior. Therefore, relying only on these historical interactions for recommendations may result in a lack of user interest at the target time. The latter factor, characterized by peaks and valleys in interaction frequency, may result from seasonal trends, special events, or promotions. These externally driven distributions may not align with individual user interests, leading to inaccurate recommendations. To address these deficiencies, we propose TGODE to both enhance and capture the long-term historical interactions. Specifically, we first construct a user time graph and item evolution graph, which utilize user personalized preferences and global item distribution information, respectively. To tackle the temporal sparsity caused by irregular user interactions, we design a time-guided diffusion generator to automatically obtain an augmented time-aware user graph. Additionally, we devise a user interest truncation factor to efficiently identify sparse time intervals and achieve balanced preference inference. After that, the augmented user graph and item graph are fed into a generalized graph neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) to align with the evolution of user preferences and item distributions. This allows two patterns of information evolution to be matched over time. Experimental results demonstrate that TGODE outperforms baseline methods across five datasets, with improvements ranging from 10% to 46%.", "AI": {"tldr": "TGODE\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u56fe\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1a\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5747\u3002\u524d\u8005\u5bfc\u81f4\u5386\u53f2\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u884c\u4e3a\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5219\u56e0\u5916\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "TGODE\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u6f14\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5229\u7528\u7528\u6237\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u504f\u597d\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u5e03\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ee5\u81ea\u52a8\u83b7\u53d6\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7528\u6237\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u622a\u65ad\u56e0\u5b50\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7528\u6237\u56fe\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u56fe\u88ab\u8f93\u5165\u5e7f\u4e49\u56fe\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTGODE\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8303\u56f4\u572810%\u81f346%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "TGODE\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u6f14\u5316\u56fe\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u622a\u65ad\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u7528\u6237\u5174\u8da3\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u7269\u54c1\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This process requires comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic criteria and symptom overlap across disorders, making it difficult to navigate based on symptoms alone. This research aims to develop a recommender system for cognitive disorder diagnosis using binary matrix representations. The core algorithm utilizes a binary matrix of disorders and their symptom combinations. It filters through the rows and columns based on the patient's current symptoms to identify potential disorders and recommend the most informative next symptoms to examine. A prototype of the recommender system was implemented in Python. Using synthetic test and some real-life data, the system successfully identified plausible disorders from an initial symptom set and recommended further symptoms to refine the diagnosis. It also provided additional context on the symptom-disorder relationships. Although this is a prototype, the recommender system shows potential as a clinical support tool. A fully-developed application of this recommender system may assist mental health professionals in identifying relevant disorders more efficiently and guiding symptom-specific follow-up investigations to improve diagnostic accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "A Python-based recommender system using binary matrices helps diagnose cognitive disorders by identifying potential disorders and recommending next symptoms, showing promise as a clinical tool.", "motivation": "Diagnosing cognitive disorders is complex due to symptom overlap and the need to identify the most informative next symptoms.

A common approach formulates recommendation as a language modeling task, where interaction histories are transformed into prompts and user preferences are learned via supervised fine-tuning. However, these methods operate solely in the textual modality and often miss users' fine-grained interests, especially when shaped by rich visual signals such as product images or movie posters. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by aligning text and vision in a shared semantic space. A prevalent training paradigm applies Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to model user preferences. Yet, two core challenges remain: 1) Imbalanced sample hardness, where random negative sampling causes overfitting on easy examples and under-training on hard ones; 2) Cross-modal semantic bias, where the fixed reference model in DPO prevents the policy model from correcting modality misalignments--especially over long sequences. To address these issues, we propose a Multimodal LLM framework that integrates Hardness-aware and Noise-regularized preference optimization for Recommendation (HaNoRec). Specifically, HaNoRec dynamically adjusts optimization weights based on both the estimated hardness of each training sample and the policy model's real-time responsiveness, prioritizing harder examples.

However, significant challenges persist in handling high-cardinality, heterogeneous, and sparse feature spaces, particularly regarding model scalability and efficiency. We identify two key bottlenecks: (i) Representation Bottleneck: Driven by the high cardinality and dynamic nature of features, model capacity is forced into sparse-activated embedding layers, leading to low-rank representations. This, in turn, triggers phenomena like \"One-Epoch\" and \"Interaction-Collapse,\" ultimately hindering model scalability.(ii) Computational Bottleneck: Integrating all heterogeneous features into a unified model triggers an explosion in the number of feature tokens, rendering traditional attention mechanisms computationally demanding and susceptible to attention dispersion. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce STORE, a unified and scalable token-based ranking framework built upon three core innovations: (1) Semantic Tokenization fundamentally tackles feature heterogeneity and sparsity by decomposing high-cardinality sparse features into a compact set of stable semantic tokens; and (2) Orthogonal Rotation Transformation is employed to rotate the subspace spanned by low-cardinality static features, which facilitates more efficient and effective feature interactions; and (3) Efficient attention that filters low-contributing tokens to improve computional efficiency while preserving model accuracy.

Retrieval Approaches with Multilingual Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) enables access to multilingual knowledge but remains challenging due to disparities in resources, scripts, and weak cross-lingual semantic alignment in embedding models. Existing pipelines often rely on translation and monolingual retrieval heuristics, which add computational overhead and noise, degrading performance. This work systematically evaluates four intervention types, namely document translation, multilingual dense retrieval with pretrained encoders, contrastive learning at word, phrase, and query-document levels, and cross-encoder re-ranking, across three benchmark datasets. We find that dense retrieval models trained specifically for CLIR consistently outperform lexical matching methods and derive little benefit from document translation. Contrastive learning mitigates language biases and yields substantial improvements for encoders with weak initial alignment, and re-ranking can be effective, but depends on the quality of the cross-encoder training data. Although high-resource languages still dominate overall performance, gains over lexical and document-translated baselines are most pronounced for low-resource and cross-script pairs. These findings indicate that cross-lingual search systems should prioritise semantic multilingual embeddings and targeted learning-based alignment over translation-based pipelines, particularly for cross-script and under-resourced languages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08CLIR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u56db\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9488\u5bf9CLIR\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8de8\u6587\u5b57\u5bf9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u9762\u4e34\u8d44\u6e90\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u6587\u5b57\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f31\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ffb\u8bd1\u548c\u5355\u8bed\u68c0\u7d22\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7c7b\u578b\uff1a\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u5728\u8bcd\u3001\u77ed\u8bed\u548c\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u9488\u5bf9CLIR\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4ece\u6587\u6863\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u751a\u5fae\u3002\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u6587\u5b57\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u3002"}}

Recently, multilingual large language models (mLLMs) have shifted query expansion from semantic augmentation with synonyms and related words to pseudo-document generation. Pseudo-documents both introduce additional relevant terms and bridge the gap between short queries and long documents, which is particularly beneficial in dense retrieval. This study evaluates recent mLLMs and fine-tuned variants across several generative expansion strategies to identify factors that drive cross-lingual retrieval performance. Results show that query length largely determines which prompting technique is effective, and that more elaborate prompts often do not yield further gains. Substantial linguistic disparities persist: cross-lingual query expansion can produce the largest improvements for languages with the weakest baselines, yet retrieval is especially poor between languages written in different scripts. Fine-tuning is found to lead to performance gains only when the training and test data are of similar format. These outcomes underline the need for more balanced multilingual and cross-lingual training and evaluation resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "Query expansion via mLLMs improves retrieval, but performance varies by query length and language script.

Instead, they often opt for a simple string concatenation of the query and LLM-generated expansion content. But is this optimal? To answer this question, we revisit and systematically evaluate traditional feedback models in the context of HyDE, a popular method that enriches query representations with LLM-generated hypothetical answer documents. Our experiments show that HyDE's effectiveness can be substantially improved when leveraging feedback algorithms such as Rocchio to extract and weight expansion terms, providing a simple way to further enhance the accuracy of LLM-based PRF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Rocchio\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347HyDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u9988\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Rocchio\u548cRM3\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982HyDE\uff09\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728HyDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Rocchio\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u6269\u5c55\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Rocchio\u7b49\u53cd\u9988\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347HyDE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u53cd\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
