Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, responsible for roughly 30\% of warming since pre-industrial times. A small number of large point sources account for a disproportionate share of emissions, creating an opportunity for substantial reductions by targeting relatively few sites. Detection and attribution of large emissions at scale for notification to asset owners remains challenging. Here, we introduce MARS-S2L, a machine learning model that detects methane emissions in publicly available multispectral satellite imagery. Trained on a manually curated dataset of over 80,000 images, the model provides high-resolution detections every two days, enabling facility-level attribution and identifying 78\% of plumes with an 8\% false positive rate at 697 previously unseen sites. Deployed operationally, MARS-S2L has issued 1,015 notifications to stakeholders in 20 countries, enabling verified, permanent mitigation of six persistent emitters, including a previously unknown site in Libya. These results demonstrate a scalable pathway from satellite detection to quantifiable methane mitigation.

Abstract: Real-time, physically-consistent predictions on low-power edge devices is critical for the next generation embodied AI systems, yet it remains a major challenge. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) combine data-driven learning with physics-based constraints to ensure the model's predictions are with underlying physical principles.However, PINNs are energy-intensive and struggle to strictly enforce physical conservation laws. Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for edge computing and real-time processing. However, naively converting PINNs to SNNs degrades physical fidelity and fails to address long-term generalization issues. To this end, this paper introduce a novel Physics-Informed Spiking Neural Network (PISNN) framework. Importantly, to ensure strict physical conservation, we design the Conservative Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (C-LIF) neuron, whose dynamics structurally guarantee local mass preservation. To achieve robust temporal generalization, we introduce a novel Conservative Flux Quantization (CFQ) strategy, which redefines neural spikes as discrete packets of physical flux. Our CFQ learns a time-invariant physical evolution operator, enabling the PISNN to become a general-purpose solver -- conservative-by-construction. Extensive experiments show that our PISNN excels on diverse benchmarks. For both the canonical 1D heat equation and the more challenging 2D Laplace's Equation, it accurately simulates the system dynamics while maintaining perfect mass conservation by design -- a feat that is challenging for conventional PINNs. This work establishes a robust framework for fusing the rigor of scientific computing with the efficiency of neuromorphic engineering, paving the way for complex, long-term, and energy-efficient physics predictions for intelligent systems.

TL;DR: DINR通过将特征演进建模为连续时间动力系统而非离散层堆叠，有效缓解了隐式神经表示中的频谱偏差问题，在图像表示、场重构和数据压缩任务中表现出更稳定的收敛性、更高的信号保真度和更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示(INRs)虽然为复杂视觉和几何信号提供了强大的连续建模框架，但频谱偏差问题仍然是限制其捕捉高频细节的基本挑战。现有的解决方案效果有限，需要新的建模框架来克服这一限制。

Result: 大量实验证实DINR相比传统静态INRs具有更稳定的收敛性、更高的信号保真度和更强的泛化能力。理论分析表明DINR增强了表达能力并改进了训练动态。

Conclusion: DINR提供了一个有效的框架来缓解INRs中的频谱偏差问题，通过连续特征演进实现更丰富、更自适应的频率表示，为复杂视觉信号的连续建模提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) provide a powerful continuous framework for modeling complex visual and geometric signals, but spectral bias remains a fundamental challenge, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details. Orthogonal to existing remedy strategies, we introduce Dynamical Implicit Neural Representations (DINR), a new INR modeling framework that treats feature evolution as a continuous-time dynamical system rather than a discrete stack of layers. This dynamical formulation mitigates spectral bias by enabling richer, more adaptive frequency representations through continuous feature evolution. Theoretical analysis based on Rademacher complexity and the Neural Tangent Kernel demonstrates that DINR enhances expressivity and improves training dynamics. Moreover, regularizing the complexity of the underlying dynamics provides a principled way to balance expressivity and generalization. Extensive experiments on image representation, field reconstruction, and data compression confirm that DINR delivers more stable convergence, higher signal fidelity, and stronger generalization than conventional static INRs.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a threshold-based framework for multiclass classification that generalizes the standard argmax rule. This is done by replacing the probabilistic interpretation of softmax outputs with a geometric one on the multidimensional simplex, where the classification depends on a multidimensional threshold. This change of perspective enables for any trained classification network an \textit{a posteriori} optimization of the classification score by means of threshold tuning, as usually carried out in the binary setting, thus allowing for a further refinement of the prediction capability of any network. Our experiments show indeed that multidimensional threshold tuning yields performance improvements across various networks and datasets. Moreover, we derive a multiclass ROC analysis based on \emph{ROC clouds} -- the attainable (FPR,TPR) operating points induced by a single multiclass threshold -- and summarize them via a \emph{Distance From Point} (DFP) score to $(0,1)$. This yields a coherent alternative to standard One-vs-Rest (OvR) curves and aligns with the observed tuning gains.

Abstract: Real-world machine learning (ML) pipelines rarely produce a single model; instead, they produce a Rashomon set of many near-optimal ones. We show that this multiplicity reshapes key aspects of trustworthiness. At the individual-model level, sparse interpretable models tend to preserve privacy but are fragile to adversarial attacks. In contrast, the diversity within a large Rashomon set enables reactive robustness: even when an attack breaks one model, others often remain accurate. Rashomon sets are also stable under small distribution shifts. However, this same diversity increases information leakage, as disclosing more near-optimal models provides an attacker with progressively richer views of the training data. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies of sparse decision trees and linear models, we characterize this robustness-privacy trade-off and highlight the dual role of Rashomon sets as both a resource and a risk for trustworthy ML.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments across diverse sectors has significantly enhanced operational efficiency, yet concurrently elevated cybersecurity vulnerabilities due to increased exposure to cyber threats. Given the limitations of traditional signature-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADS) in identifying emerging and zero-day threats, this study investigates the effectiveness of two unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, Isolation Forest (IF) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM), using the TON_IoT thermostat dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was performed based on standard metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score) alongside critical resource utilization metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. Experimental results revealed that IF consistently outperformed OC-SVM, achieving higher detection accuracy, superior precision, and recall, along with a significantly better F1-score. Furthermore, Isolation Forest demonstrated a markedly superior computational footprint, making it more suitable for deployment on resource-constrained IoT edge devices. These findings underscore Isolation Forest's robustness in high-dimensional and imbalanced IoT environments and highlight its practical viability for real-time anomaly detection.

Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.

Abstract: The brain has evolved to effectively control the body, and in order to understand the relationship we need to model the sensorimotor transformations underlying embodied control. As part of a coordinated effort, we are developing a general-purpose platform for behavior-driven simulation modeling high fidelity behavioral dynamics, biomechanics, and neural circuit architectures underlying embodied control. We present a pipeline for taking kinematics data from the neuroscience lab and creating a pipeline for recapitulating those natural movements in a biomechanical model. We implement a imitation learning framework to perform a dexterous forelimb reaching task with a musculoskeletal model in a simulated physics environment. The mouse arm model is currently training at faster than 1 million training steps per second due to GPU acceleration with JAX and Mujoco-MJX. We present results that indicate that adding naturalistic constraints on energy and velocity lead to simulated musculoskeletal activity that better predict real EMG signals. This work provides evidence to suggest that energy and control constraints are critical to modeling musculoskeletal motor control.

Abstract: In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of two variants of the XGBoost regression model, the full-capacity and lightweight (tiny) versions, for predicting the concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Using the AirQualityUCI dataset collected over one year in an urban environment, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation based on widely accepted metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Bias Error (MBE), and the coefficient of determination (R2). In addition, we assessed resource-oriented metrics such as inference time, model size, and peak RAM usage. The full XGBoost model achieved superior predictive accuracy for both pollutants, while the tiny model, though slightly less precise, offered substantial computational benefits with significantly reduced inference time and model storage requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying simplified models in resource-constrained environments without compromising predictive quality. This makes the tiny XGBoost model suitable for real-time air-quality monitoring in IoT and embedded applications.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) with semantic IDs (SIDs) has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional recommendation approaches due to its performance gains, capitalization on semantic information provided through language model embeddings, and inference and storage efficiency. Existing GR with SIDs works frame the probability of a sequence of SIDs corresponding to a user's interaction history using autoregressive modeling. While this has led to impressive next item prediction performances in certain settings, these autoregressive GR with SIDs models suffer from expensive inference due to sequential token-wise decoding, potentially inefficient use of training data and bias towards learning short-context relationships among tokens. Inspired by recent breakthroughs in NLP, we propose to instead model and learn the probability of a user's sequence of SIDs using masked diffusion. Masked diffusion employs discrete masking noise to facilitate learning the sequence distribution, and models the probability of masked tokens as conditionally independent given the unmasked tokens, allowing for parallel decoding of the masked tokens. We demonstrate through thorough experiments that our proposed method consistently outperforms autoregressive modeling. This performance gap is especially pronounced in data-constrained settings and in terms of coarse-grained recall, consistent with our intuitions. Moreover, our approach allows the flexibility of predicting multiple SIDs in parallel during inference while maintaining superior performance to autoregressive modeling.

Abstract: We present PDE-FM, a modular foundation model for physics-informed machine learning that unifies spatial, spectral, and temporal reasoning across heterogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) systems. PDE-FM combines spatial-spectral tokenization, physics-aware conditioning, and a Mamba-based state-space backbone with an operator-theoretic decoder, enabling scalable and data-efficient modeling of complex physical dynamics. In contrast to task-specific neural operators, PDE-FM is pretrained once on diverse PDE datasets and can be transferred to new physical regimes without architectural or data-specific modifications. Evaluated on twelve 2D and 3D datasets from The Well benchmark - spanning hydrodynamic, radiative, elastic, and astrophysical phenomena - PDE-FM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in six domains, reducing mean VRMSE by 46% relative to prior operator-learning baselines. The model demonstrates robust cross-physics generalization, excelling in turbulent and radiative systems while maintaining strong performance in linear and steady-state regimes. These results suggest that large-scale pretraining across diverse physical processes can yield transferable representations of dynamics, marking a step toward unified, foundation-level surrogates for multi-physics simulation and scientific discovery.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.

Abstract: Extracting compact, physically interpretable representations from high-dimensional scientific data is a persistent challenge due to the complex, nonlinear structures inherent in physical systems. We propose a Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (GM-VAE) framework designed to address this by integrating an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-inspired training scheme with a novel spectral interpretability metric. Unlike conventional VAEs that jointly optimize reconstruction and clustering (often leading to training instability), our method utilizes a block-coordinate descent strategy, alternating between expectation and maximization steps. This approach stabilizes training and naturally aligns latent clusters with distinct physical regimes. To objectively evaluate the learned representations, we introduce a quantitative metric based on graph-Laplacian smoothness, which measures the coherence of physical quantities across the latent manifold. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework on datasets of increasing complexity: surface reaction ODEs, Navier-Stokes wake flows, and experimental laser-induced combustion Schlieren images. The results show that our GM-VAE yields smooth, physically consistent manifolds and accurate regime clustering, offering a robust data-driven tool for interpreting turbulent and reactive flow systems.

Abstract: Modern machine learning models often combine multiple input streams of data to more accurately capture the information that informs their decisions. In multimodal machine learning, choosing the strategy for fusing data together requires careful consideration of the application's accuracy and latency requirements, as fusing the data at earlier or later stages in the model architecture can lead to performance changes in accuracy and latency. To demonstrate this tradeoff, we investigate different fusion strategies using a hybrid BERT and vision network framework that integrates image and text data. We explore two different vision networks: MobileNetV2 and ViT. We propose three models for each vision network, which fuse data at late, intermediate, and early stages in the architecture. We evaluate the proposed models on the CMU MOSI dataset and benchmark their latency on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. Our experimental results demonstrate that while late fusion yields the highest accuracy, early fusion offers the lowest inference latency. We describe the three proposed model architectures and discuss the accuracy and latency tradeoffs, concluding that data fusion earlier in the model architecture results in faster inference times at the cost of accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-modal foundation models align images, text, and other modalities in a shared embedding space but remain vulnerable to adversarial illusions (Zhang et al., 2025), where imperceptible perturbations disrupt cross-modal alignment and mislead downstream tasks. To counteract the effects of adversarial illusions, we propose a task-agnostic mitigation mechanism that reconstructs the input from the attacker's perturbed input through generative models, e.g., Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to maintain natural alignment. To further enhance our proposed defense mechanism, we adopt a generative sampling strategy combined with a consensus-based aggregation scheme over the outcomes of the generated samples. Our experiments on the state-of-the-art multi-modal encoders show that our approach substantially reduces the illusion attack success rates to near-zero and improves cross-modal alignment by 4% (42 to 46) and 11% (32 to 43) in unperturbed and perturbed input settings respectively, providing an effective and model-agnostic defense against adversarial illusions.

Abstract: Machine learning models for 3D molecular property prediction typically rely on atom-based representations, which may overlook subtle physical information. Electron density maps -- the direct output of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy -- offer a continuous, physically grounded alternative. We compare three voxel-based input types for 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs): atom types, raw electron density, and density gradient magnitude, across two molecular tasks -- protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PDBbind) and quantum property prediction (QM9). We focus on voxel-based CNNs because electron density is inherently volumetric, and voxel grids provide the most natural representation for both experimental and computed densities. On PDBbind, all representations perform similarly with full data, but in low-data regimes, density-based inputs outperform atom types, while a shape-based baseline performs comparably -- suggesting that spatial occupancy dominates this task. On QM9, where labels are derived from Density Functional Theory (DFT) but input densities from a lower-level method (XTB), density-based inputs still outperform atom-based ones at scale, reflecting the rich structural and electronic information encoded in density. Overall, these results highlight the task- and regime-dependent strengths of density-derived inputs, improving data efficiency in affinity prediction and accuracy in quantum property modeling.

Abstract: Predicting human trust in AI systems is crucial for safe integration of AI-based decision support tools, especially in healthcare. This study proposes a multi-modal machine learning framework that combines image and galvanic skin response (GSR) data to predict early user trust in AI- or human-generated recommendations in a simulated ADHD mHealth context. Facial video data were processed using OpenCV for frame extraction and transferred learning with a pre-trained transformer model to derive emotional features. Concurrently, GSR signals were decomposed into tonic and phasic components to capture physiological arousal patterns. Two temporal windows were defined for trust prediction: the Early Detection Window (6 to 3 seconds before decision-making) and the Proximal Detection Window (3 to 0 seconds before decision-making). For each window, trust prediction was conducted separately using image-based, GSR-based, and multimodal (image + GSR) features. Each modality was analyzed using machine learning algorithms, and the top-performing unimodal models were integrated through a multimodal stacking ensemble for final prediction. Experimental results showed that combining facial and physiological cues significantly improved prediction performance. The multimodal stacking framework achieved an accuracy of 0.83, F1-score of 0.88, and ROC-AUC of 0.87 in the Early Detection Window, and an accuracy of 0.75, F1-score of 0.82, and ROC-AUC of 0.66 in the Proximal Detection Window. These results demonstrate the potential of bio signals as real-time, objective markers of user trust, enabling adaptive AI systems that dynamically adjust their responses to maintain calibrated trust which is a critical capability in mental health applications where mis-calibrated trust can affect diagnostic and treatment outcomes.

Abstract: In federated learning (FL), models must \emph{converge quickly} under tight communication budgets while \emph{generalizing} across non-IID client distributions. These twin requirements have naturally led to two widely used techniques: client/server \emph{momentum} to accelerate progress, and \emph{sharpness-aware minimization} (SAM) to prefer flat solutions. However, simply combining momentum and SAM leaves two structural issues unresolved in non-IID FL. We identify and formalize two failure modes: \emph{local-global curvature misalignment} (local SAM directions need not reflect the global loss geometry) and \emph{momentum-echo oscillation} (late-stage instability caused by accumulated momentum). To our knowledge, these failure modes have not been jointly articulated and addressed in the FL literature. We propose \textbf{FedWMSAM} to address both failure modes. First, we construct a momentum-guided global perturbation from server-aggregated momentum to align clients' SAM directions with the global descent geometry, enabling a \emph{single-backprop} SAM approximation that preserves efficiency. Second, we couple momentum and SAM via a cosine-similarity adaptive rule, yielding an early-momentum, late-SAM two-phase training schedule. We provide a non-IID convergence bound that \emph{explicitly models the perturbation-induced variance} $σ_ρ^2=σ^2+(Lρ)^2$ and its dependence on $(S, K, R, N)$ on the theory side. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures, and the results validate the effectiveness, adaptability, and robustness of our method, demonstrating its superiority in addressing the optimization challenges of Federated Learning.

Abstract: Understanding how backdoor data influences neural network training dynamics remains a complex and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of the impact of backdoor data on the learning process, with a particular focus on the distinct behaviors between the target class and other clean classes. Leveraging the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle connected with clustering of internal representation, We find that backdoor attacks create unique mutual information (MI) signatures, which evolve across training phases and differ based on the attack mechanism. Our analysis uncovers a surprising trade-off: visually conspicuous attacks like BadNets can achieve high stealthiness from an information-theoretic perspective, integrating more seamlessly into the model than many visually imperceptible attacks. Building on these insights, we propose a novel, dynamics-based stealthiness metric that quantifies an attack's integration at the model level. We validate our findings and the proposed metric across multiple datasets and diverse attack types, offering a new dimension for understanding and evaluating backdoor threats. Our code is available in: https://github.com/XinyuLiu71/Information_Bottleneck_Backdoor.git.

Abstract: The integration of IoT and AI has unlocked innovation across industries, but growing privacy concerns and data isolation hinder progress. Traditional centralized ML struggles to overcome these challenges, which has led to the rise of Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized paradigm that enables collaborative model training without sharing local raw data. FL ensures data privacy, reduces communication overhead, and supports scalability, yet its heterogeneity adds complexity compared to centralized approaches. This survey focuses on three main FL research directions: personalization, optimization, and robustness, offering a structured classification through a hybrid methodology that combines bibliometric analysis with systematic review to identify the most influential works. We examine challenges and techniques related to heterogeneity, efficiency, security, and privacy, and provide a comprehensive overview of aggregation strategies, including architectures, synchronization methods, and diverse federation objectives. To complement this, we discuss practical evaluation approaches and present experiments comparing aggregation methods under IID and non-IID data distributions. Finally, we outline promising research directions to advance FL, aiming to guide future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally relies on scalar reward signals, limiting its ability to leverage the rich semantic knowledge often available in real-world tasks. In contrast, humans learn efficiently by combining numerical feedback with language, prior knowledge, and common sense. We introduce Prompted Policy Search (ProPS), a novel RL method that unifies numerical and linguistic reasoning within a single framework. Unlike prior work that augment existing RL components with language, ProPS places a large language model (LLM) at the center of the policy optimization loop-directly proposing policy updates based on both reward feedback and natural language input. We show that LLMs can perform numerical optimization in-context, and that incorporating semantic signals, such as goals, domain knowledge, and strategy hints can lead to more informed exploration and sample-efficient learning. ProPS is evaluated across fifteen Gymnasium tasks, spanning classic control, Atari games, and MuJoCo environments, and compared to seven widely-adopted RL algorithms (e.g., PPO, SAC, TRPO). It outperforms all baselines on eight out of fifteen tasks and demonstrates substantial gains when provided with domain knowledge. These results highlight the potential of unifying semantics and numerics for transparent, generalizable, and human-aligned RL.

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) provides a promising foundation for edge artificial intelligence (AI) by enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, limited and heterogeneous local datasets, as well as resource-constrained deployment, severely degrade both model generalization and resource utilization, leading to a compromised learning performance. Therefore, we propose a parameter-efficient FEEL framework that jointly leverages model pruning and client selection to tackle such challenges. First, we derive an information-theoretic generalization statement that characterizes the discrepancy between training and testing function losses and embed it into the convergence analysis. It reveals that a larger local generalization statement can undermine the global convergence. Then, we formulate a generalization-aware average squared gradient norm bound minimization problem, by jointly optimizing the pruning ratios, client selection, and communication-computation resources under energy and delay constraints. Despite its non-convexity, the resulting mixed-integer problem is efficiently solved via an alternating optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design achieves superior learning performance than state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of coupling generalization-aware analysis with system-level optimization for efficient FEEL.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a simple and computationally efficient framework to evaluate whether machine learning models align with the structure of the data they learn from; that is, whether \textit{the model says what the data says}. Unlike existing interpretability methods that focus exclusively on explaining model behavior, our approach establishes a baseline derived directly from the data itself. Drawing inspiration from Rubin's Potential Outcomes Framework, we quantify how strongly each feature separates the two outcome groups in a binary classification task, moving beyond traditional descriptive statistics to estimate each feature's effect on the outcome. By comparing these data-derived feature rankings against model-based explanations, we provide practitioners with an interpretable and model-agnostic method to assess model--data alignment.

Abstract: Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilistic estimates, but incur high computational cost because predictions require sampling weight distributions and multiple forward passes. The Probabilistic Forward Pass (PFP) offers a highly efficient approximation to Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI) by assuming Gaussian-distributed weights and activations, enabling fully analytic uncertainty propagation and replacing sampling with a single deterministic forward pass. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training, compiling, optimizing, and deploying PFP-based BNNs on embedded ARM CPUs. Using the TVM deep learning compiler, we implement a dedicated library of Gaussian-propagating operators for multilayer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks, combined with manual and automated tuning strategies. Ablation studies show that PFP consistently outperforms SVI in computational efficiency, achieving speedups of up to 4200x for small mini-batches. PFP-BNNs match SVI-BNNs on Dirty-MNIST in accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and OOD detection while greatly reducing compute cost. These results highlight the potential of combining Bayesian approximations with code generation to enable efficient BNN deployment on resource-constrained systems.

Abstract: Escalating cyber threats and the high-dimensional complexity of IoT traffic have outpaced classical anomaly detection methods. While deep learning offers improvements, computational bottlenecks limit real-time deployment at scale. We present a quantum autoencoder (QAE) framework that compresses network traffic into discriminative latent representations and employs quantum support vector classification (QSVC) for intrusion detection. Evaluated on three datasets, our approach achieves improved accuracy on ideal simulators and on the IBM Quantum hardware demonstrating practical quantum advantage on current NISQ devices. Crucially, moderate depolarizing noise acts as implicit regularization, stabilizing training and enhancing generalization. This work establishes quantum machine learning as a viable, hardware-ready solution for real-world cybersecurity challenges.

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances downstream task performance by generating informative features through mathematical feature crossing. Despite the advancements in deep learning, feature transformation remains essential for structured data, where deep models often struggle to capture complex feature interactions. Prior literature on automated feature transformation has achieved success but often relies on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to inefficient and time-consuming processes. Recent works employ reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance traditional approaches through a more effective trial-and-error way. However, two limitations remain: 1) Dynamic feature expansion during the transformation process, which causes instability and increases the learning complexity for RL agents; 2) Insufficient cooperation and communication between agents, which results in suboptimal feature crossing operations and degraded model performance. To address them, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-agent RL framework to enable cooperative and scalable feature transformation. The framework comprises three heterogeneous agents, grouped into two types, each designed to select essential features and operations for feature crossing. To enhance communication among these agents, we implement a shared critic mechanism that facilitates information exchange during feature transformation. To handle the dynamically expanding feature space, we tailor multi-head attention-based feature agents to select suitable features for feature crossing. Additionally, we introduce a state encoding technique during the optimization process to stabilize and enhance the learning dynamics of the RL agents, resulting in more robust and reliable transformation policies. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and interpretability of our model.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed in ecosystems where they repeatedly interact not only with each other but also with humans. In this work, we study these human-AI ecosystems from a theoretical perspective, focusing on the classical framework of repeated pricing games. In our stylized model, the AI agents play equilibrium strategies, and one or more humans manually perform the pricing task instead of adopting an AI agent, thereby defecting to a no-regret strategy. Motivated by how populations of AI agents can sustain supracompetitive prices, we investigate whether high prices persist under such defections. Our main finding is that even a single human defection can destabilize collusion and drive down prices, and multiple defections push prices even closer to competitive levels. We further show how the nature of collusion changes under defection-aware AI agents. Taken together, our results characterize when algorithmic collusion is fragile--and when it persists--in mixed ecosystems of AI agents and humans.

Abstract: Non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) based on Code-Modulated Visual Evoked Potentials (C-VEPs) require highly robust decoding methods to address temporal variability and session-dependent noise in EEG signals. This study proposes and evaluates several deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 63-bit m-sequence reconstruction and classification, and Siamese networks for similarity-based decoding, alongside canonical correlation analysis (CCA) baselines. EEG data were recorded from 13 healthy adults under single-target flicker stimulation. The proposed deep models significantly outperformed traditional approaches, with distance-based decoding using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and constrained EMD showing greater robustness to latency variations than Euclidean and Mahalanobis metrics. Temporal data augmentation with small shifts further improved generalization across sessions. Among all models, the multi-class Siamese network achieved the best overall performance with an average accuracy of 96.89%, demonstrating the potential of data-driven deep architectures for reliable, single-trial C-VEP decoding in adaptive non-invasive BCI systems.

Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in critical applications but are mostly "black boxes" due to their lack of transparency. Local explanation approaches, such as LIME, address this issue by approximating the behavior of complex models near a test instance using simple, interpretable models. However, these approaches often suffer from instability and poor local fidelity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adversarially Bracketed Local Explanation (ABLE) to address these limitations. Our approach first generates a set of neighborhood points near the test instance, x_test, by adding bounded Gaussian noise. For each neighborhood point D, we apply an adversarial attack to generate an adversarial point A with minimal perturbation that results in a different label than D. A second adversarial attack is then performed on A to generate a point A' that has the same label as D (and thus different than A). The points A and A' form an adversarial pair that brackets the local decision boundary for x_test. We then train a linear model on these adversarial pairs to approximate the local decision boundary. Experimental results on six UCI benchmark datasets across three deep neural network architectures demonstrate that our approach achieves higher stability and fidelity than the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Click-through rates prediction is critical in modern advertising systems, where ranking relevance and user engagement directly impact platform efficiency and business value. In this project, we explore how to model CTR more effectively using a large-scale Taobao dataset released by Alibaba. We start with supervised learning models, including logistic regression and Light-GBM, that are trained on static features such as user demographics, ad attributes, and contextual metadata. These models provide fast, interpretable benchmarks, but have limited capabilities to capture patterns of behavior that drive clicks. To better model user intent, we combined behavioral data from hundreds of millions of interactions over a 22-day period. By extracting and encoding user action sequences, we construct representations of user interests over time. We use deep learning models to fuse behavioral embeddings with static features. Among them, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have achieved significant performance improvements. To capture temporal dynamics, we designed a Transformer-based architecture that uses a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual dependencies across behavioral sequences, modeling not only what the user interacts with, but also the timing and frequency of interactions. Transformer improves AUC by 2.81 % over the baseline (LR model), with the largest gains observed for users whose interests are diverse or change over time. In addition to modeling, we propose an A/B testing strategy for real-world evaluation. We also think about the broader implications: personalized ad targeting technology can be applied to public health scenarios to achieve precise delivery of health information or behavior guidance. Our research provides a roadmap for advancing click-through rate predictions and extending their value beyond e-commerce.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on developing multi-template machine learning (ML) surrogate models and applying them to the inverse design of transformers (XFMRs) in radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs). Our study starts with benchmarking four widely used ML architectures, including MLP-, CNN-, UNet-, and GT-based models, using the same datasets across different XFMR topologies. To improve modeling accuracy beyond these baselines, we then propose a new frequency-domain self-transfer learning technique that exploits correlations between adjacent frequency bands, leading to around 30%-50% accuracy improvement in the S-parameters prediction. Building on these models, we further develop an inverse design framework based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES) algorithm. This framework is validated using multiple impedance-matching tasks, all demonstrating fast convergence and trustworthy performance. These results advance the goal of AI-assisted specs-to-GDS automation for RFICs and provide RFIC designers with actionable tools for integrating AI into their workflows.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dynamic and actionable framework for securing agentic AI systems in enterprise deployment. We contend that safety and security are not merely fixed attributes of individual models but also emergent properties arising from the dynamic interactions among models, orchestrators, tools, and data within their operating environments. We propose a new way of identification of novel agentic risks through the lens of user safety. Although, for traditional LLMs and agentic models in isolation, safety and security has a clear separation, through the lens of safety in agentic systems, they appear to be connected. Building on this foundation, we define an operational agentic risk taxonomy that unifies traditional safety and security concerns with novel, uniquely agentic risks, including tool misuse, cascading action chains, and unintended control amplification among others. At the core of our approach is a dynamic agentic safety and security framework that operationalizes contextual agentic risk management by using auxiliary AI models and agents, with human oversight, to assist in contextual risk discovery, evaluation, and mitigation. We further address one of the most challenging aspects of safety and security of agentic systems: risk discovery through sandboxed, AI-driven red teaming. We demonstrate the framework effectiveness through a detailed case study of NVIDIA flagship agentic research assistant, AI-Q Research Assistant, showcasing practical, end-to-end safety and security evaluations in complex, enterprise-grade agentic workflows. This risk discovery phase finds novel agentic risks that are then contextually mitigated. We also release the dataset from our case study, containing traces of over 10,000 realistic attack and defense executions of the agentic workflow to help advance research in agentic safety.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning hypergraphs with shortest-path queries (SP-queries), and present the first provably optimal online algorithm for a broad and natural class of hypertrees that we call orderly hypertrees. Our online algorithm can be transformed into a provably optimal offline algorithm. Orderly hypertrees can be positioned within the Fagin hierarchy of acyclic hypergraph (well-studied in database theory), and strictly encompass the broadest class in this hierarchy that is learnable with subquadratic SP-query complexity.
  Recognizing that in some contexts, such as evolutionary tree reconstruction, distance measurements can degrade with increased distance, we also consider a learning model that uses bounded distance queries. In this model, we demonstrate asymptotically tight complexity bounds for learning general hypertrees.

Abstract: We liberate Equilibrium Propagation (EP) from the limit of infinitesimal perturbations by establishing a finite-nudge foundation for local credit assignment. By modeling network states as Gibbs-Boltzmann distributions rather than deterministic points, we prove that the gradient of the difference in Helmholtz free energy between a nudged and free phase is exactly the difference in expected local energy derivatives. This validates the classic Contrastive Hebbian Learning update as an exact gradient estimator for arbitrary finite nudging, requiring neither infinitesimal approximations nor convexity. Furthermore, we derive a generalized EP algorithm based on the path integral of loss-energy covariances, enabling learning with strong error signals that standard infinitesimal approximations cannot support.

Abstract: Drowsy driving is a growing cause of traffic accidents, prompting recent exploration of electroencephalography (EEG)-based drowsiness detection systems. However, the inherent variability of EEG signals due to psychological and physical factors necessitates a cumbersome calibration process. In particular, the inter-subject variability of EEG signals leads to a domain shift problem, which makes it challenging to generalize drowsiness detection models to unseen target subjects. To address these issues, we propose a novel driver drowsiness detection framework that leverages online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to dynamically adjust to target subject distributions. Our proposed method updates the learnable parameters in batch normalization (BN) layers, while preserving pretrained normalization statistics, resulting in a modified configuration that ensures effective adaptation during test time. We incorporate a memory bank that dynamically manages streaming EEG segments, selecting samples based on their reliability determined by negative energy scores and persistence time. In addition, we introduce prototype learning to ensure robust predictions against distribution shifts over time. We validated our method on the sustained-attention driving dataset collected in a simulated environment, where drowsiness was estimated from delayed reaction times during monotonous lane-keeping tasks. Our experiments show that our method outperforms all baselines, achieving an average F1-score of 81.73\%, an improvement of 11.73\% over the best TTA baseline. This demonstrates that our proposed method significantly enhances the adaptability of EEG-based drowsiness detection systems in non-i.i.d. scenarios.

Abstract: The electric power sector is a leading source of air pollutant emissions, impacting the public health of nearly every community. Although regulatory measures have reduced air pollutants, fossil fuels remain a significant component of the energy supply, highlighting the need for more advanced demand-side approaches to reduce the public health impacts. To enable health-informed demand-side management, we introduce HealthPredictor, a domain-specific AI model that provides an end-to-end pipeline linking electricity use to public health outcomes. The model comprises three components: a fuel mix predictor that estimates the contribution of different generation sources, an air quality converter that models pollutant emissions and atmospheric dispersion, and a health impact assessor that translates resulting pollutant changes into monetized health damages. Across multiple regions in the United States, our health-driven optimization framework yields substantially lower prediction errors in terms of public health impacts than fuel mix-driven baselines. A case study on electric vehicle charging schedules illustrates the public health gains enabled by our method and the actionable guidance it can offer for health-informed energy management. Overall, this work shows how AI models can be explicitly designed to enable health-informed energy management for advancing public health and broader societal well-being.

Abstract: Score matching has become a central training objective in modern generative modeling, particularly in diffusion models, where it is used to learn high-dimensional data distributions through the estimation of score functions. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of the optimization behavior of score matching, particularly in over-parameterized regimes, remains limited. In this work, we study gradient descent for training over-parameterized models to learn a single Gaussian distribution. Specifically, we use a student model with $n$ learnable parameters and train it on data generated from a single ground-truth Gaussian using the population score matching objective. We analyze the optimization dynamics under multiple regimes. When the noise scale is sufficiently large, we prove a global convergence result for gradient descent. In the low-noise regime, we identify the existence of a stationary point, highlighting the difficulty of proving global convergence in this case. Nevertheless, we show convergence under certain initialization conditions: when the parameters are initialized to be exponentially small, gradient descent ensures convergence of all parameters to the ground truth. We further prove that without the exponentially small initialization, the parameters may not converge to the ground truth. Finally, we consider the case where parameters are randomly initialized from a Gaussian distribution far from the ground truth. We prove that, with high probability, only one parameter converges while the others diverge, yet the loss still converges to zero with a $1/τ$ rate, where $τ$ is the number of iterations. We also establish a nearly matching lower bound on the convergence rate in this regime. This is the first work to establish global convergence guarantees for Gaussian mixtures with at least three components under the score matching framework.

Abstract: Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.

Abstract: Many real-world scenarios involving streaming information can be represented as temporal graphs, where data flows through dynamic changes in edges over time. Anomaly detection in this context has the objective of identifying unusual temporal connections within the graph structure. Detecting edge anomalies in real time is crucial for mitigating potential risks. Unlike traditional anomaly detection, this task is particularly challenging due to concept drifts, large data volumes, and the need for real-time response. To face these challenges, we introduce ARES, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for edge streams. ARES combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for feature extraction with Half-Space Trees (HST) for anomaly scoring. GNNs capture both spike and burst anomalous behaviors within streams by embedding node and edge properties in a latent space, while HST partitions this space to isolate anomalies efficiently. ARES operates in an unsupervised way without the need for prior data labeling. To further validate its detection capabilities, we additionally incorporate a simple yet effective supervised thresholding mechanism. This approach leverages statistical dispersion among anomaly scores to determine the optimal threshold using a minimal set of labeled data, ensuring adaptability across different domains. We validate ARES through extensive evaluations across several real-world cyber-attack scenarios, comparing its performance against existing methods while analyzing its space and time complexity.

Abstract: Recent efforts in smart manufacturing have enhanced aerospace fuselage assembly processes, particularly by innovating shape adjustment techniques to minimize dimensional gaps between assembled sections. Existing approaches have shown promising results but face the issue of low sample efficiency from the manufacturing systems. It arises from the limitation of the classical Monte Carlo method when uncovering the mean response from a distribution. In contrast, recent work has shown that quantum algorithms can achieve the same level of estimation accuracy with significantly fewer samples than the classical Monte Carlo method from distributions. Therefore, we can adopt the estimation of the quantum algorithm to obtain the estimation from real physical systems (distributions). Motivated by this advantage, we propose a Quantum Bayesian Optimization (QBO) framework for precise shape control during assembly to improve the sample efficiency in manufacturing practice. Specifically, this approach utilizes a quantum oracle, based on finite element analysis (FEA)-based models or surrogate models, to acquire a more accurate estimation of the environment response with fewer queries for a certain input. QBO employs an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) as the acquisition function to strategically select input values that are most likely to maximize the objective function. It has been theoretically proven to require much fewer samples while maintaining comparable optimization results. In the case study, force-controlled actuators are applied to one fuselage section to adjust its shape and reduce the gap to the adjoining section. Experimental results demonstrate that QBO achieves significantly lower dimensional error and uncertainty compared to classical methods, particularly using the same queries from the simulation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances across domains, yet their massive size hinders deployment in resource-constrained settings. Model compression addresses this challenge, with low-rank factorization emerging as a particularly effective method for reducing size, memory, and computation while maintaining accuracy. However, while these compressed models boast of benign performance and system-level advantages, their trustworthiness implications remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of how low-rank factorization affects LLM trustworthiness across privacy, adversarial robustness, fairness, and ethical alignment. We evaluate multiple LLMs of different sizes and variants compressed with diverse low-rank algorithms, revealing key insights: (1) low-rank compression preserves or improves training data privacy but weakens PII protection during conversation; (2) adversarial robustness is generally preserved and often enhanced, even under deep compression; (3) ethical reasoning degrades in zero-shot settings but partially recovers with few-shot prompting; (4) fairness declines under compression. Beyond compression, we investigate how model scale and fine-tuning affect trustworthiness, as both are important in low-rank methods. To guide trustworthy compression strategies, we end our paper with a gradient-based attribution analysis to identify which layers in LLMs contribute most to adversarial robustness.

Abstract: The report goes through the main steps of replicating and improving the article "Adaptive Liquidity Provision in Uniswap V3 with Deep Reinforcement Learning." The replication part includes how to obtain data from the Uniswap Subgraph, details of the implementation, and comments on the results. After the replication, I propose a new structure based on the original model, which combines Mamba with DDQN and a new reward function. In this new structure, I clean the data again and introduce two new baselines for comparison. As a result, although the model has not yet been applied to all datasets, it shows stronger theoretical support than the original model and performs better in some tests.

Abstract: We study the problem of selecting a small, representative action subset from an extremely large action space shared across a family of reinforcement learning (RL) environments -- a fundamental challenge in applications like inventory management and recommendation systems, where direct learning over the entire space is intractable. Our goal is to identify a fixed subset of actions that, for every environment in the family, contains a near-optimal action, thereby enabling efficient learning without exhaustively evaluating all actions.
  This work extends our prior results for meta-bandits to the more general setting of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We prove that our existing algorithm achieves performance comparable to using the full action space. This theoretical guarantee is established under a relaxed, non-centered sub-Gaussian process model, which accommodates greater environmental heterogeneity. Consequently, our approach provides a computationally and sample-efficient solution for large-scale combinatorial decision-making under uncertainty.

Abstract: The number of simultaneously recorded neurons follows an exponentially increasing trend in implantable brain-machine interfaces (iBMIs). Integrating the neural decoder in the implant is an effective data compression method for future wireless iBMIs. However, the non-stationarity of the system makes the performance of the decoder unreliable. To avoid frequent retraining of the decoder and to ensure the safety and comfort of the iBMI user, continuous learning is essential for real-life applications. Since Deep Spiking Neural Networks (DSNNs) are being recognized as a promising approach for developing resource-efficient neural decoder, we propose continuous learning approaches with Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms adapted for DSNNs. Banditron and AGREL are chosen as the two candidate RL algorithms since they can be trained with limited computational resources, effectively addressing the non-stationary problem and fitting the energy constraints of implantable devices. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed methods, we conducted both open-loop and closed-loop experiments. The accuracy of open-loop experiments conducted with DSNN Banditron and DSNN AGREL remains stable over extended periods. Meanwhile, the time-to-target in the closed-loop experiment with perturbations, DSNN Banditron performed comparably to that of DSNN AGREL while achieving reductions of 98% in memory access usage and 99% in the requirements for multiply- and-accumulate (MAC) operations during training. Compared to previous continuous learning SNN decoders, DSNN Banditron requires 98% less computes making it a prime candidate for future wireless iBMI systems.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Variations such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections can disrupt satellites, power grids, and communications, making accurate modeling essential for space weather forecasting. While 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are used to simulate and investigate these variations in the solar wind, they tend to be computationally expensive, limiting their usefulness in investigating the impacts of boundary condition uncertainty. In this work, we develop a surrogate for steady state solar wind modeling, using a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). We compare our model to a previously developed numerical surrogate for this task called HUX, and we show that the SFNO achieves comparable or better performance across several metrics. Though HUX retains advantages in physical smoothness, this underscores the need for improved evaluation criteria rather than a flaw in SFNO. As a flexible and trainable approach, SFNO enables efficient real-time forecasting and can improve with more data. The source code and more visual results are available at https://github.com/rezmansouri/solarwind-sfno-velocity.

Abstract: To reliably navigate ever-shifting real-world environments, agents must grapple with incomplete knowledge and adapt their behavior through experience. However, current evaluations largely focus on tasks that leave no ambiguity, and do not measure agents' ability to adaptively learn and reason through the experiences they accrued. We exemplify the need for this in-context experiential learning in a product recommendation context, where agents must navigate shifting customer preferences and product landscapes through natural language dialogue. We curate a benchmark for experiential learning and active exploration (BELA) that combines (1) rich real-world products from Amazon, (2) a diverse collection of user personas to represent heterogeneous yet latent preferences, and (3) a LLM user simulator powered by the persona to create rich interactive trajectories. We observe that current frontier models struggle to meaningfully improve across episodes, underscoring the need for agentic systems with strong in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: This work presents a probabilistic digital twin framework for response prediction in dynamical systems governed by misspecified physics. The approach integrates Gaussian Process Latent Force Models (GPLFM) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to enable end-to-end uncertainty-aware inference and prediction. In the diagnosis phase, model-form errors (MFEs) are treated as latent input forces to a nominal linear dynamical system and jointly estimated with system states using GPLFM from sensor measurements. A BNN is then trained on posterior samples to learn a probabilistic nonlinear mapping from system states to MFEs, while capturing diagnostic uncertainty. For prognosis, this mapping is used to generate pseudo-measurements, enabling state prediction via Kalman filtering. The framework allows for systematic propagation of uncertainty from diagnosis to prediction, a key capability for trustworthy digital twins. The framework is demonstrated using four nonlinear examples: a single degree of freedom (DOF) oscillator, a multi-DOF system, and two established benchmarks -- the Bouc-Wen hysteretic system and the Silverbox experimental dataset -- highlighting its predictive accuracy and robustness to model misspecification.

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of small language models (SLMs) for agentic tasks (function/tool/API calling) with a focus on running agents on edge devices without reliance on cloud infrastructure. We evaluate SLMs using the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) framework and describe parameter-driven optimization strategies that include supervised fine-tuning (SFT), parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization, preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and hybrid methods. We report results for models including TinyAgent, TinyLlama, Qwen, and xLAM across BFCL categories (simple, multiple, parallel, parallel-multiple, and relevance detection), both in live and non-live settings, and in multi-turn evaluations. We additionally detail a DPO training pipeline constructed from AgentBank data (e.g., ALFRED), including our conversion of SFT data to chosen-rejected pairs using TinyLlama responses as rejected outputs and manual validation. Our results demonstrate clear accuracy differences across model scales where medium-sized models (1-3B parameters) significantly outperform ultra-compact models (<1B parameters), achieving up to 65.74% overall accuracy, and 55.62% multi-turn accuracy with hybrid optimization. This study highlights the importance of hybrid optimization strategies that enable small language models to deliver accurate, efficient, and stable agentic AI on edge devices, making privacy-preserving, low-latency autonomous agents practical beyond the cloud.

Abstract: Most post-training methods for text-to-image samplers focus on model weights: either fine-tuning the backbone for alignment or distilling it for few-step efficiency. We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.

Abstract: Intensive care unit (ICU) data are highly irregular, heterogeneous, and temporally fragmented, posing challenges for generalizable clinical prediction. We present PULSE-ICU, a self-supervised foundation model that learns event-level ICU representations from large-scale EHR sequences without resampling or manual feature engineering. A unified embedding module encodes event identity, continuous values, units, and temporal attributes, while a Longformer-based encoder enables efficient modeling of long trajectories. PULSE-ICU was fine-tuned across 18 prediction tasks, including mortality, intervention forecasting, and phenotype identification, achieving strong performance across task types. External validation on eICU, HiRID, and P12 showed substantial improvements with minimal fine-tuning, demonstrating robustness to domain shift and variable constraints. These findings suggest that foundation-style modeling can improve data efficiency and adaptability, providing a scalable framework for ICU decision support across diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function that explains expert behavior using only fixed demonstration data, without any additional online interaction. We propose BiCQL-ML, a policy-free offline IRL algorithm that jointly optimizes a reward function and a conservative Q-function in a bi-level framework, thereby avoiding explicit policy learning. The method alternates between (i) learning a conservative Q-function via Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) under the current reward, and (ii) updating the reward parameters to maximize the expected Q-values of expert actions while suppressing over-generalization to out-of-distribution actions. This procedure can be viewed as maximum likelihood estimation under a soft value matching principle. We provide theoretical guarantees that BiCQL-ML converges to a reward function under which the expert policy is soft-optimal. Empirically, we show on standard offline RL benchmarks that BiCQL-ML improves both reward recovery and downstream policy performance compared to existing offline IRL baselines.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training across clients without compromising privacy. While most existing FL methods assume homogeneous model architectures, client heterogeneity in data and resources renders this assumption impractical, motivating model-heterogeneous FL. To address this problem, we propose Federated Representation Entanglement (FedRE), a framework built upon a novel form of client knowledge termed entangled representation. In FedRE, each client aggregates its local representations into a single entangled representation using normalized random weights and applies the same weights to integrate the corresponding one-hot label encodings into the entangled-label encoding. Those are then uploaded to the server to train a global classifier. During training, each entangled representation is supervised across categories via its entangled-label encoding, while random weights are resampled each round to introduce diversity, mitigating the global classifier's overconfidence and promoting smoother decision boundaries. Furthermore, each client uploads a single cross-category entangled representation along with its entangled-label encoding, mitigating the risk of representation inversion attacks and reducing communication overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRE achieves an effective trade-off among model performance, privacy protection, and communication overhead. The codes are available at https://github.com/AIResearch-Group/FedRE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability to generate code, yet their outputs often violate syntactic or semantic constraints when guided only through natural language prompts. We introduce TreeCoder, the most general and flexible framework to date for exploring decoding strategies, constraints, and hyperparameters in LLMs, and use it in code generation to enforce correctness and structure during decoding rather than relying on prompt engineering. TreeCoder represents decoding as a tree search over candidate programs, where both decoding strategies and constraint functions - such as style, syntax, execution - are treated as first-class, optimisable components. This design enables systematic exploration and automatic tuning of decoding configurations using standard optimisation techniques. Experiments on the MBPP (Python) and SQL-Spider benchmarks show that TreeCoder consistently improves accuracy across open-source models such as CodeLlama, Mistral and DeepSeek, often outperforming their unconstrained baselines by considerable margins.

Abstract: Online mirror descent (OMD) is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that underlies many algorithms in optimization, machine learning and sequential decision-making. The OMD iterates are defined as solutions to optimization subproblems which, oftentimes, can be solved only approximately, leading to an inexact version of the algorithm. Nonetheless, existing OMD analyses typically assume an idealized error free setting, thereby limiting our understanding of performance guarantees that should be expected in practice. In this work we initiate a systematic study into inexact OMD, and uncover an intricate relation between regularizer smoothness and robustness to approximation errors. When the regularizer is uniformly smooth, we establish a tight bound on the excess regret due to errors. Then, for barrier regularizers over the simplex and its subsets, we identify a sharp separation: negative entropy requires exponentially small errors to avoid linear regret, whereas log-barrier and Tsallis regularizers remain robust even when the errors are only polynomial. Finally, we show that when the losses are stochastic and the domain is the simplex, negative entropy regains robustness-but this property does not extend to all subsets, where exponentially small errors are again necessary to avoid suboptimal regret.

Abstract: Traditional pricing paradigms, once dominated by static models and rule-based heuristics, are increasingly being replaced by dynamic, data-driven approaches powered by machine learning algorithms. Despite their growing sophistication, most dynamic pricing algorithms focus on optimizing the price of each product independently, disregarding potential interactions among items. By neglecting these interdependencies in consumer demand across related goods, sellers may fail to capture the full potential of coordinated pricing strategies. In this paper, we address this problem by exploring dynamic pricing mechanisms designed explicitly for complementary products, aiming to exploit their joint demand structure to maximize overall revenue. We present an online learning algorithm considering both positive and negative interactions between products' demands. The algorithm utilizes transaction data to identify advantageous complementary relationships through an integer programming problem between different items, and then optimizes pricing strategies using data-driven and computationally efficient multi-armed bandit solutions based on heteroscedastic Gaussian processes. We validate our solution in a simulated environment, and we demonstrate that our solution improves the revenue w.r.t. a comparable learning algorithm ignoring such interactions.

Abstract: Forecasting tumor growth is critical for optimizing treatment. Classical growth models such as the Gompertz and Bertalanffy equations capture general tumor dynamics but may fail to adapt to patient-specific variability, particularly with limited data available. In this study, we leverage Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs), two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), to construct adaptive tumor growth models capable of learning from experimental data. Using the Gompertz model as a baseline, we replace rigid terms with adaptive neural networks to capture hidden dynamics through robust modeling in the Julia programming language. We use our models to perform forecasting under data constraints and symbolic recovery to transform the learned dynamics into explicit mathematical expressions. Our approach has the potential to improve predictive accuracy, guiding dynamic and effective treatment strategies for improved clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients while preserving data privacy. Traditional FL methods often use a global model to fit all clients, assuming that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, when this assumption does not hold, the global model accuracy may drop significantly, limiting FL applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we propose FLUX, a novel clustering-based FL (CFL) framework that addresses the four most common types of distribution shifts during both training and test time. To this end, FLUX leverages privacy-preserving client-side descriptor extraction and unsupervised clustering to ensure robust performance and scalability across varying levels and types of distribution shifts. Unlike existing CFL methods addressing non-IID client distribution shifts, FLUX i) does not require any prior knowledge of the types of distribution shifts or the number of client clusters, and ii) supports test-time adaptation, enabling unseen and unlabeled clients to benefit from the most suitable cluster-specific models. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks, two real-world datasets and ten state-of-the-art baselines show that FLUX improves performance and stability under diverse distribution shifts, achieving an average accuracy gain of up to 23 percentage points over the best-performing baselines, while maintaining computational and communication overhead comparable to FedAvg.

Abstract: We curate the DeXposure dataset, the first large-scale dataset for inter-protocol credit exposure in decentralized financial networks, covering global markets of 43.7 million entries across 4.3 thousand protocols, 602 blockchains, and 24.3 thousand tokens, from 2020 to 2025. A new measure, value-linked credit exposure between protocols, is defined as the inferred financial dependency relationships derived from changes in Total Value Locked (TVL). We develop a token-to-protocol model using DefiLlama metadata to infer inter-protocol credit exposure from the token's stock dynamics, as reported by the protocols. Based on the curated dataset, we develop three benchmarks for machine learning research with financial applications: (1) graph clustering for global network measurement, tracking the structural evolution of credit exposure networks, (2) vector autoregression for sector-level credit exposure dynamics during major shocks (Terra and FTX), and (3) temporal graph neural networks for dynamic link prediction on temporal graphs. From the analysis, we observe (1) a rapid growth of network volume, (2) a trend of concentration to key protocols, (3) a decline of network density (the ratio of actual connections to possible connections), and (4) distinct shock propagation across sectors, such as lending platforms, trading exchanges, and asset management protocols. The DeXposure dataset and code have been released publicly. We envision they will help with research and practice in machine learning as well as financial risk monitoring, policy analysis, DeFi market modeling, amongst others. The dataset also contributes to machine learning research by offering benchmarks for graph clustering, vector autoregression, and temporal graph analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) quantization facilitates deploying LLMs in resource-limited settings, but existing methods that combine incompatible gradient optimization and quantization truncation lead to serious convergence pathology. This prolongs quantization time and degrades LLMs' task performance. Our studies confirm that Straight-Through Estimator (STE) on Stiefel manifolds introduce non-smoothness and gradient noise, obstructing optimization convergence and blocking high-fidelity quantized LLM development despite extensive training. To tackle the above limitations, we propose SingleQuant, a single-pass quantization framework that decouples from quantization truncation, thereby eliminating the above non-smoothness and gradient noise factors. Specifically, SingleQuant constructs Alignment Rotation Transformation (ART) and Uniformity Rotation Transformation (URT) targeting distinct activation outliers, where ART achieves smoothing of outlier values via closed-form optimal rotations, and URT reshapes distributions through geometric mapping. Both matrices comprise strictly formulated Givens rotations with predetermined dimensions and rotation angles, enabling promising LLMs task performance within a short time. Experimental results demonstrate SingleQuant's superiority over the selected baselines across diverse tasks on 7B-70B LLMs. To be more precise, SingleQuant enables quantized LLMs to achieve higher task performance while necessitating less time for quantization. For example, when quantizing LLaMA-2-13B, SingleQuant achieves 1,400$\times$ quantization speedup and increases +0.57\% average task performance compared to the selected best baseline.

Abstract: Power Flow (PF) calculation based on machine learning (ML) techniques offer significant computational advantages over traditional numerical methods but often struggle to maintain full physical consistency. This paper introduces a physics-informed test-time training (PI-TTT) framework that enhances the accuracy and feasibility of ML-based PF surrogates by enforcing AC power flow equalities and operational constraints directly at inference time. The proposed method performs a lightweight self-supervised refinement of the surrogate outputs through few gradient-based updates, enabling local adaptation to unseen operating conditions without requiring labeled data. Extensive experiments on the IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems and the PEGASE 1354-bus network show that PI-TTT reduces power flow residuals and operational constraint violations by one to two orders of magnitude compared with purely ML-based models, while preserving their computational advantage. The results demonstrate that PI-TTT provides fast, accurate, and physically reliable predictions, representing a promising direction for scalable and physics-consistent learning in power system analysis.

Abstract: Existing active learning (AL) strategies capture fundamentally different notions of data value, e.g., uncertainty or representativeness. Consequently, the effectiveness of strategies can vary substantially across datasets, models, and even AL cycles. Committing to a single strategy risks suboptimal performance, as no single strategy dominates throughout the entire AL process. We introduce REFINE, an ensemble AL method that combines multiple strategies without knowing in advance which will perform best. In each AL cycle, REFINE operates in two stages: (1) Progressive filtering iteratively refines the unlabeled pool by considering an ensemble of AL strategies, retaining promising candidates capturing different notions of value. (2) Coverage-based selection then chooses a final batch from this refined pool, ensuring all previously identified notions of value are accounted for. Extensive experiments across 6 classification datasets and 3 foundation models show that REFINE consistently outperforms individual strategies and existing ensemble methods. Notably, progressive filtering serves as a powerful preprocessing step that improves the performance of any individual AL strategy applied to the refined pool, which we demonstrate on an audio spectrogram classification use case. Finally, the ensemble of REFINE can be easily extended with upcoming state-of-the-art AL strategies.

Abstract: On-device machine learning (ML) has become a fundamental component of emerging mobile applications. Adaptive model deployment delivers efficient inference for heterogeneous device capabilities and performance requirements through customizing neural architectures. SuperNet-based approaches offer a promising solution by generating a large number of model variants from a pre-trained ML model. However, applying SuperNet in existing frameworks suffers from tedious model-aware development and time-consuming hardware-aware profiling, which limits their practical adoption.
  We present AutoTailor, the first framework to enable automated, end-to-end SuperNet-based adaptive model deployment for edge devices. Unlike manual SuperNet construction, AutoTailor employs a computation graph-guided compilation approach to automatically transform user-provided ML models into SuperNets. To support efficient specialization, AutoTailor incorporates learning-free latency and accuracy predictors, enabling low-cost yet accurate performance prediction. Our extended evaluations demonstrate that AutoTailor reduces the lines of code for SuperNet construction by 11--27$\times$, decreases hardware-aware profiling costs by at least 11$\times$, and achieves up to 15.60\% absolute accuracy improvement and 60.03\% latency reduction compared to state-of-the-art approaches across diverse models and devices.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained considerable attention in the field of physiological signal analysis. They leverage long-range dependencies and complex patterns in temporal signals, allowing them to achieve performance superior to traditional RNN and CNN models. However, they require high computational intensity and memory demands. In this work, we present Efficient-Husformer, a novel Transformer-based architecture developed with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) for multi-class stress detection across two multimodal physiological datasets (WESAD and CogLoad). The main contributions of this work are: (1) the design of a structured search space, targeting effective hyperparameter optimization; (2) a comprehensive ablation study evaluating the impact of architectural decisions; (3) consistent performance improvements over the original Husformer, with the best configuration achieving an accuracy of 88.41 and 92.61 (improvements of 13.83% and 6.98%) on WESAD and CogLoad datasets, respectively. The best-performing configuration is achieved with the (L + dm) or (L + FFN) modality combinations, using a single layer, 3 attention heads, a model dimension of 18/30, and FFN dimension of 120/30, resulting in a compact model with only about 30k parameters.

Abstract: Continual learning, one's ability to adapt to a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a major challenge in machine learning and a key gap between artificial and human intelligence. While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

Conclusion: 这些发现推动了基于时间序列动态聚类位置的高级插值方法研究，相关结论适用于其他受间接可观测因素控制的环境变量。

Abstract: Geospatial observational datasets are often limited to point measurements, making temporal prediction and spatial interpolation essential for constructing continuous fields. This study evaluates two deep learning strategies for addressing this challenge: (1) a grid-to-grid approach, where gridded predictors are used to model rasterised targets (aggregation before modelling), and (2) a grid-to-point approach, where gridded predictors model point targets, followed by kriging interpolation to fill the domain (aggregation after modelling). Using groundwater storage data from Bangladesh as a case study, we compare the effcacy of these approaches. Our findings indicate that spatial interpolation is substantially more difficult than temporal prediction. In particular, nearest neighbours are not always the most similar, and uncertainties in geology strongly influence point temporal behaviour. These insights motivate future work on advanced interpolation methods informed by clustering locations based on time series dynamics. Demonstrated on groundwater storage, the conclusions are applicable to other environmental variables governed by indirectly observable factors.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning, particularly through contrastive methods like TS2Vec, has advanced the analysis of time series data. However, these models often falter in forecasting tasks because their objective functions prioritize instance discrimination over capturing the deterministic patterns, such as seasonality and trend, that are critical for accurate prediction. This paper introduces TS2Vec-Ensemble, a novel hybrid framework designed to bridge this gap. Our approach enhances the powerful, implicitly learned dynamics from a pretrained TS2Vec encoder by fusing them with explicit, engineered time features that encode periodic cycles. This fusion is achieved through a dual-model ensemble architecture, where two distinct regression heads -- one focused on learned dynamics and the other on seasonal patterns -- are combined using an adaptive weighting scheme. The ensemble weights are optimized independently for each forecast horizon, allowing the model to dynamically prioritize short-term dynamics or long-term seasonality as needed. We conduct extensive experiments on the ETT benchmark datasets for both univariate and multivariate forecasting. The results demonstrate that TS2Vec-Ensemble consistently and significantly outperforms the standard TS2Vec baseline and other state-of-the-art models, validating our hypothesis that a hybrid of learned representations and explicit temporal priors is a superior strategy for long-horizon time series forecasting.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), it is often advantageous to consider additional constraints on the action space to ensure safety or action relevance. Existing work on such action-constrained RL faces challenges regarding effective policy updates, computational efficiency, and predictable runtime. Recent work proposes to use truncated normal distributions for stochastic policy gradient methods. However, the computation of key characteristics, such as the entropy, log-probability, and their gradients, becomes intractable under complex constraints. Hence, prior work approximates these using the non-truncated distributions, which severely degrades performance. We argue that accurate estimation of these characteristics is crucial in the action-constrained RL setting, and propose efficient numerical approximations for them. We also provide an efficient sampling strategy for truncated policy distributions and validate our approach on three benchmark environments, which demonstrate significant performance improvements when using accurate estimations.

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验显示，PISA相比先前方法在分类准确率上提升最多5%

Conclusion: 动态子图聚合策略能更有效地利用多个因果模式，显著提升图数据的分布外泛化能力

Abstract: Recent work has extended the invariance principle for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization from Euclidean to graph data, where challenges arise due to complex structures and diverse distribution shifts in node attributes and topology. To handle these, Chen et al. proposed CIGA (Chen et al., 2022b), which uses causal modeling and an information-theoretic objective to extract a single invariant subgraph capturing causal features. However, this single-subgraph focus can miss multiple causal patterns. Liu et al. (2025) addressed this with SuGAr, which learns and aggregates diverse invariant subgraphs via a sampler and diversity regularizer, improving robustness but still relying on simple uniform or greedy aggregation. To overcome this, the proposed PISA framework introduces a dynamic MLP-based aggregation that prioritizes and combines subgraph representations more effectively. Experiments on 15 datasets, including DrugOOD (Ji et al., 2023), show that PISA achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy than prior methods.

Abstract: We present adversarial flow models, a class of generative models that unifies adversarial models and flow models. Our method supports native one-step or multi-step generation and is trained using the adversarial objective. Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38. We additionally show the possibility of end-to-end training of 56-layer and 112-layer models through depth repetition without any intermediate supervision, and achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 using a single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance across various tasks. However, their autoregressive decoding process poses significant challenges for efficient deployment on existing AI hardware. Quantization alleviates memory and compute pressure by compressing weights, activations, and KV caches to low precisions while preserving generation quality. However, existing quantization frameworks typically focus on perplexity or classification accuracy, often omitting critical trustworthiness metrics. This gap introduces risks when applying quantized LLMs to downstream high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of quantization on four trustworthiness metrics (adversarial robustness, fairness, machine ethics, and out-of-distribution robustness) and identify the instability across compression ratios and quantization methods. Building on these observations, we develop a novel precision-ensemble voting approach that leverages predictions from mixed-precision variants of the same model and consistently improves performance by up to $5.8\%$ on trustworthiness metrics. Our results highlight the importance of considering trustworthiness when developing model compression techniques and point to research opportunities at the intersection of compression and trustworthiness for safety-critical applications.

Based on real-life case studies, ranging from small to medium to large size, we demonstrate that the generated explanations are more meaningful than those computed by state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) output ranked lists of items, such as movies or restaurants, that users may find interesting, based on the user's past ratings and ratings from other users. RSs increasingly incorporate differential privacy (DP) to protect user data, raising questions about how privacy mechanisms affect both recommendation accuracy and fairness. We conduct a comprehensive, cross-model evaluation of two DP mechanisms, differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) and local differential privacy (LDP), applied to four recommender systems (Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)) on the MovieLens-1M and Yelp datasets. We find that stronger privacy consistently reduces utility, but not uniformly. NCF under DPSGD shows the smallest accuracy loss (under 10 percent at epsilon approximately 1), whereas SVD and BPR experience larger drops, especially for users with niche preferences. VAE is the most sensitive to privacy, with sharp declines for sparsely represented groups. The impact on bias metrics is similarly heterogeneous. DPSGD generally reduces the gap between recommendations of popular and less popular items, whereas LDP preserves existing patterns more closely. These results highlight that no single DP mechanism is uniformly superior; instead, each provides trade-offs under different privacy regimes and data conditions.

Abstract: Accurate sensor placement is critical for modeling spatio-temporal systems such as environmental and climate processes. Neural Processes (NPs), particularly Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs), provide scalable probabilistic models with uncertainty estimates, making them well-suited for data-driven sensor placement. However, existing approaches rely on total predictive uncertainty, which conflates epistemic and aleatoric components, that may lead to suboptimal sensor selection in ambiguous regions. To address this, we propose expected reduction in epistemic uncertainty as a new acquisition function for sensor placement. To enable this, we extend ConvCNPs with a Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) output head for epistemic uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results suggest that epistemic uncertainty driven sensor placement more effectively reduces model error than approaches based on overall uncertainty.

Abstract: We find that in Hanabi, one of the most complex and popular benchmarks for zero-shot coordination and ad-hoc teamplay, a standard implementation of independent PPO with a slightly higher entropy coefficient 0.05 instead of the typically used 0.01, achieves a new state-of-the-art in cross-play between different seeds, beating by a significant margin all previous specialized algorithms, which were specifically designed for this setting. We provide an intuition for why sufficiently high entropy regularization ensures that different random seed produce joint policies which are mutually compatible. We also empirically find that a high $λ_{\text{GAE}}$ around 0.9, and using RNNs instead of just feed-forward layers in the actor-critic architecture, strongly increase inter-seed cross-play. While these results demonstrate the dramatic effect that hyperparameters can have not just on self-play scores but also on cross-play scores, we show that there are simple Dec-POMDPs though, in which standard policy gradient methods with increased entropy regularization are not able to achieve perfect inter-seed cross-play, thus demonstrating the continuing necessity for new algorithms for zero-shot coordination.

Abstract: In the supervised binary classification setting, score-oriented losses have been introduced with the aim of optimizing a chosen performance metric directly during the training phase, thus avoiding \textit{a posteriori} threshold tuning. To do this, in their construction, the decision threshold is treated as a random variable provided with a certain \textit{a priori} distribution. In this paper, we use a recently introduced multidimensional threshold-based classification framework to extend such score-oriented losses to multiclass classification, defining the Multiclass Score-Oriented Loss (MultiSOL) functions. As also demonstrated by several classification experiments, this proposed family of losses is designed to preserve the main advantages observed in the binary setting, such as the direct optimization of the target metric and the robustness to class imbalance, achieving performance comparable to other state-of-the-art loss functions and providing new insights into the interaction between simplex geometry and score-oriented learning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT o1, ChatGPT o3, and DeepSeek R1 have shown great potential in solving difficult problems. However, current LLM evaluation benchmarks are limited to one-step interactions. Some of the existing sequence decision-making environments, such as TextStarCraftII and LLM-PySC2, are too complicated and require hours of interaction to complete a game. In this paper, we introduce LLM-Cave, a benchmark and light environment for LLM reasoning and decision-making systems. This environment is a classic instance in the era of Symbolism. Artificial intelligence enables the agent to explore the environment and avoid potential losses by reasoning about nearby dangers using partial observable state information. In the experiment, we evaluated the sequential reasoning ability, decision-making performance and computational efficiency of mainstream large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o-mini, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that while Deepseek-R1 achieved the highest success rate on complex reasoning tasks, smaller models like 4o-mini significantly narrowed the performance gap on challenges by employing Chain of Speculation and Planner-Critic strategies, at the expense of reduced computational efficiency. This indicates that structured, multi-step reasoning combined with an LLM-based feedback mechanism can substantially enhance an LLM's decision-making capabilities, providing a promising direction for improving reasoning in weaker models and suggesting a new reasoning-centered benchmark for LLM assessment.

Abstract: Adapting large-scale foundation flow and diffusion generative models to optimize task-specific objectives while preserving prior information is crucial for real-world applications such as molecular design, protein docking, and creative image generation. Existing principled fine-tuning methods aim to maximize the expected reward of generated samples, while retaining knowledge from the pre-trained model via KL-divergence regularization. In this work, we tackle the significantly more general problem of optimizing general utilities beyond average rewards, including risk-averse and novelty-seeking reward maximization, diversity measures for exploration, and experiment design objectives among others. Likewise, we consider more general ways to preserve prior information beyond KL-divergence, such as optimal transport distances and Renyi divergences. To this end, we introduce Flow Density Control (FDC), a simple algorithm that reduces this complex problem to a specific sequence of simpler fine-tuning tasks, each solvable via scalable established methods. We derive convergence guarantees for the proposed scheme under realistic assumptions by leveraging recent understanding of mirror flows. Finally, we validate our method on illustrative settings, text-to-image, and molecular design tasks, showing that it can steer pre-trained generative models to optimize objectives and solve practically relevant tasks beyond the reach of current fine-tuning schemes.

Abstract: A new approach to data-driven discovery of Koopman eigenfunctions without a pre-defined set of basis functions is proposed. The approach is based on a reference trajectory, for which the Koopman mode amplitudes are first identified, and the Koopman mode decomposition is transformed to a new basis, which contains fundamental functions of eigenvalues and time. The initial values of the eigenfunctions are obtained by projecting trajectories onto this basis via a regularized least-squares fit. A global optimizer was employed to optimize the eigenvalues. Mapping initial-state values to eigenfunction values reveals their spatial structure, enabling the numerical computation of their gradients. Thus, deviations from the Koopman partial differential equation are penalized, leading to more robust solutions. The approach was successfully tested on several benchmark nonlinear dynamical systems, including the FitzHugh-Nagumo system with inputs, van der Pol and Duffing oscillators, and a 2-spool turbojet engine with control. The study demonstrates that incorporating principal eigenvalues and spatial structure integrity promotion significantly improves the accuracy of Koopman predictors. The approach effectively discovers Koopman spectral components even with sparse state-space sampling and reveals geometric features of the state space, such as invariant partitions. Finally, the numerical approximation of the eigenfunction gradient can be used for input dynamics modeling and control design. The results support the practicality of the approach for use with various dynamical systems.

Abstract: Traditional optimization methods excel in well-defined search spaces but struggle with design problems where transformations and design parameters are difficult to define. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by dynamically interpreting design spaces and leveraging encoded domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce AUTO, an LLM agent framework that treats design optimization as a gradient-free search problem guided by strategic LLM reasoning. The framework employs two collaborative agents: a Strategist that selects between exploration and exploitation strategies, and an Implementor that executes detailed designs. Applied to GPU code optimization -- a domain critical to fields from machine learning to scientific computing -- AUTO generates solutions competitive with expert implementations for chemical kinetics integration and dense matrix multiplication. The framework achieves 50-70% search efficiency relative to Bayesian optimization methodologies. It completes optimizations in approximately 8 hours at an estimated cost of up to \$159 per run, compared to an estimated cost of up to \$480 with median-wage software developers. These findings open the door to automating design optimization in ill-defined search spaces with limited prior information.

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS) has recently emerged as an effective dimensionality reduction method for unlabeled multi-view data. However, most existing methods mainly use first-order similarity graphs to preserve local structure, often overlooking the global structure that can be captured by second-order similarity. In addition, a few MUFS methods leverage predefined second-order similarity graphs, making them vulnerable to noise and outliers and resulting in suboptimal feature selection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel MUFS method, termed Structure-aware Hybrid-order sImilarity learNing for multi-viEw unsupervised Feature Selection (SHINE-FS), to address the aforementioned problem. SHINE-FS first learns consensus anchors and the corresponding anchor graph to capture the cross-view relationships between the anchors and the samples. Based on the acquired cross-view consensus information, it generates low-dimensional representations of the samples, which facilitate the reconstruction of multi-view data by identifying discriminative features. Subsequently, it employs the anchor-sample relationships to learn a second-order similarity graph. Furthermore, by jointly learning first-order and second-order similarity graphs, SHINE-FS constructs a hybrid-order similarity graph that captures both local and global structures, thereby revealing the intrinsic data structure to enhance feature selection. Comprehensive experimental results on real multi-view datasets show that SHINE-FS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Building reliable deception detectors for AI systems -- methods that could predict when an AI system is being strategically deceptive without necessarily requiring behavioural evidence -- would be valuable in mitigating risks from advanced AI systems. But evaluating the reliability and efficacy of a proposed deception detector requires examples that we can confidently label as either deceptive or honest. We argue that we currently lack the necessary examples and further identify several concrete obstacles in collecting them. We provide evidence from conceptual arguments, analysis of existing empirical works, and analysis of novel illustrative case studies. We also discuss the potential of several proposed empirical workarounds to these problems and argue that while they seem valuable, they also seem insufficient alone. Progress on deception detection likely requires further consideration of these problems.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in large language models, foundation models have been developed for zero-shot time series forecasting, enabling prediction on datasets unseen during pretraining. These large-scale models, trained on vast collections of time series, learn generalizable representations for both point and probabilistic forecasting, reducing the need for task-specific architectures and manual tuning.
  In this work, we review the main architectures, pretraining strategies, and optimization methods used in such models, and study the effect of fine-tuning after pretraining to enhance their performance on specific datasets. Our empirical results show that fine-tuning generally improves zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially for long-term horizons.

Abstract: A common recipe to improve diffusion models at test-time so that samples score highly against a user-specified reward is to introduce the gradient of the reward into the dynamics of the diffusion itself. This procedure is often ill posed, as user-specified rewards are usually only well defined on the data distribution at the end of generation. While common workarounds to this problem are to use a denoiser to estimate what a sample would have been at the end of generation, we propose a simple solution to this problem by working directly with a flow map. By exploiting a relationship between the flow map and velocity field governing the instantaneous transport, we construct an algorithm, Flow Map Trajectory Tilting (FMTT), which provably performs better ascent on the reward than standard test-time methods involving the gradient of the reward. The approach can be used to either perform exact sampling via importance weighting or principled search that identifies local maximizers of the reward-tilted distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach against other look-ahead techniques, and show how the flow map enables engagement with complicated reward functions that make possible new forms of image editing, e.g. by interfacing with vision language models.

Abstract: We present Generative Anchored Fields (GAF), a generative model that learns independent endpoint predictors $J$ (noise) and $K$ (data) rather than a trajectory predictor. The velocity field $v=K-J$ emerges from their time-conditioned disagreement. This factorization enables \textit{Transport Algebra}: algebraic operation on learned $\{(J_n,K_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ heads for compositional control. With class-specific $K_n$ heads, GAF supports a rich family of directed transport maps between a shared base distribution and multiple modalities, enabling controllable interpolation, hybrid generation, and semantic morphing through vector arithmetic. We achieve strong sample quality (FID 7.5 on CelebA-HQ $64\times 64$) while uniquely providing compositional generation as an architectural primitive. We further demonstrate, GAF has lossless cyclic transport between its initial and final state with LPIPS=$0.0$. Code available at https://github.com/IDLabMedia/GAF

Abstract: To develop an integrated transcriptome-proteome framework for identifying concurrent biomarkers predictive of radiation response, as measured by survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2), in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) proteomic data were collected from 73 and 46 NSCLC cell lines, respectively. Following preprocessing, 1,605 shared genes were retained for analysis. Feature selection was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression with a frequency-based ranking criterion under five-fold cross-validation repeated ten times. Support vector regression (SVR) models were constructed using transcriptome-only, proteome-only, and combined transcriptome-proteome feature sets. Model performance was assessed by the coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Correlation analyses evaluated concordance between RNA and protein expression and the relationships of selected biomarkers with SF2. RNA-protein expression exhibited significant positive correlations (median Pearson's r = 0.363). Independent pipelines identified 20 prioritized gene signatures from transcriptomic, proteomic, and combined datasets. Models trained on single-omic features achieved limited cross-omic generalizability, while the combined model demonstrated balanced predictive accuracy in both datasets (R2=0.461, RMSE=0.120 for transcriptome; R2=0.604, RMSE=0.111 for proteome). This study presents the first proteotranscriptomic framework for SF2 prediction in NSCLC, highlighting the complementary value of integrating transcriptomic and proteomic data. The identified concurrent biomarkers capture both transcriptional regulation and functional protein activity, offering mechanistic insights and translational potential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in RTL generation, but different models excel on different tasks because of architecture and training differences. Prior work mainly prompts or finetunes a single model. What remains not well studied is how to coordinate multiple different LLMs so they jointly improve RTL quality while also reducing cost, instead of running all models and choosing the best output. We define this as the multi-LLM RTL generation problem. We propose VeriDispatcher, a multi-LLM RTL generation framework that dispatches each RTL task to suitable LLMs based on pre-inference difficulty prediction. For each model, we train a compact classifier over semantic embeddings of task descriptions, using difficulty scores derived from benchmark variants that combine syntax, structural similarity, and functional correctness. At inference, VeriDispatcher uses these predictors to route tasks to a selected subset of LLMs. Across 10 diverse LLMs on RTLLM and VerilogEval, VeriDispatcher achieves up to 18% accuracy improvement on RTLLM using only 40% of commercial calls, and on VerilogEval maintains accuracy while reducing commercial usage by 25%, enabling cost-effective, high-quality LLM deployment in hardware design automation.

Abstract: We explore the possibility of exact algorithmic learning with gradient-based methods and introduce a differentiable framework capable of strong length generalization on arithmetic tasks. Our approach centers on Differentiable Finite-State Transducers (DFSTs), a Turing-complete model family that avoids the pitfalls of prior architectures by enabling constant-precision, constant-time generation, and end-to-end log-parallel differentiable training. Leveraging policy-trajectory observations from expert agents, we train DFSTs to perform binary and decimal addition and multiplication. Remarkably, models trained on tiny datasets generalize without error to inputs thousands of times longer than the training examples. These results show that training differentiable agents on structured intermediate supervision could pave the way towards exact gradient-based learning of algorithmic skills.

Abstract: Many machine learning models perform well when making predictions within the training data range, but often struggle when required to extrapolate beyond it. Symbolic regression (SR) using genetic programming (GP) can generate flexible models but is prone to unreliable behaviour in extrapolation. This paper investigates whether adding synthetic data can help improve performance in such cases. We apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to identify regions in the input space where the training data is sparse. Synthetic data is then generated in those regions using a knowledge distillation approach: a teacher model generates predictions on new input points, which are then used to train a student model. We evaluate this method across six benchmark datasets, using neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and GP both as teacher models (to generate synthetic data) and as student models (trained on the augmented data). Results show that GP models can often improve when trained on synthetic data, especially in extrapolation areas. However, the improvement depends on the dataset and teacher model used. The most important improvements are observed when synthetic data from GPe is used to train GPp in extrapolation regions. Changes in interpolation areas show only slight changes. We also observe heterogeneous errors, where model performance varies across different regions of the input space. Overall, this approach offers a practical solution for better extrapolation. Note: An earlier version of this work appeared in the GECCO 2025 Workshop on Symbolic Regression. This arXiv version corrects several parts of the original submission.

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning has emerged as a practical alternative to fully supervised learning when complete and accurate labels are costly or infeasible to acquire. However, many existing methods are tailored to specific supervision patterns -- such as positive-unlabeled (PU), unlabeled-unlabeled (UU), complementary-label (CLL), partial-label (PLL), or similarity-unlabeled annotations -- and rely on post-hoc corrections to mitigate instability induced by indirect supervision. We propose a principled, unified framework that bypasses such post-hoc adjustments by directly formulating a stable surrogate risk grounded in the structure of weakly supervised data. The formulation naturally subsumes diverse settings -- including PU, UU, CLL, PLL, multi-class unlabeled, and tuple-based learning -- under a single optimization objective. We further establish a non-asymptotic generalization bound via Rademacher complexity that clarifies how supervision structure, model capacity, and sample size jointly govern performance. Beyond this, we analyze the effect of class-prior misspecification on the bound, deriving explicit terms that quantify its impact, and we study identifiability, giving sufficient conditions -- most notably via supervision stratification across groups -- under which the target risk is recoverable. Extensive experiments show consistent gains across class priors, dataset scales, and class counts -- without heuristic stabilization -- while exhibiting robustness to overfitting.

Abstract: Causal machine learning (Causal ML) aims to answer "what if" questions using machine learning algorithms, making it a promising tool for high-stakes decision-making. Yet, empirical evaluation practices in Causal ML remain limited. Existing benchmarks often rely on a handful of hand-crafted or semi-synthetic datasets, leading to brittle, non-generalizable conclusions. To bridge this gap, we introduce CausalProfiler, a synthetic benchmark generator for Causal ML methods. Based on a set of explicit design choices about the class of causal models, queries, and data considered, the CausalProfiler randomly samples causal models, data, queries, and ground truths constituting the synthetic causal benchmarks. In this way, Causal ML methods can be rigorously and transparently evaluated under a variety of conditions. This work offers the first random generator of synthetic causal benchmarks with coverage guarantees and transparent assumptions operating on the three levels of causal reasoning: observation, intervention, and counterfactual. We demonstrate its utility by evaluating several state-of-the-art methods under diverse conditions and assumptions, both in and out of the identification regime, illustrating the types of analyses and insights the CausalProfiler enables.

Abstract: Time series data is ubiquitous, with forecasting applications spanning from finance to healthcare. Beyond popular deterministic methods, generative models are gaining attention due to advancements in areas like image synthesis and video generation, as well as their inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions. However, existing generative approaches mostly involve recurrent generative operations or repeated denoising steps, making the prediction laborious, particularly for long-term forecasting. Most of them only conduct experiments for relatively short-term forecasting, with limited comparison to deterministic methods in long-term forecasting, leaving their practical advantages unclear. This paper presents TARFVAE, a novel generative framework that combines the Transformer-based autoregressive flow (TARFLOW) and variational autoencoder (VAE) for efficient one-step generative time series forecasting. Inspired by the rethinking that complex architectures for extracting time series representations might not be necessary, we add a flow module, TARFLOW, to VAE to promote spontaneous learning of latent variables that benefit predictions. TARFLOW enhances VAE's posterior estimation by breaking the Gaussian assumption, thereby enabling a more informative latent space. TARFVAE uses only the forward process of TARFLOW, avoiding autoregressive inverse operations and thus ensuring fast generation. During generation, it samples from the prior latent space and directly generates full-horizon forecasts via the VAE decoder. With simple MLP modules, TARFVAE achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models across different forecast horizons on benchmark datasets while maintaining efficient prediction speed, demonstrating its effectiveness as an efficient and powerful solution for generative time series forecasting.

Abstract: When people reason about cause and effect, they often consider many competing "what if" scenarios before deciding which explanation fits best. Analogously, advanced language models capable of causal inference can consider multiple interventions and counterfactuals to judge the validity of causal claims. Crucially, this type of reasoning is less like a single calculation and more like an internal dialogue between alternative hypotheses. In this paper, we make this dialogue explicit through a dual-agent debate framework where one model provides a structured causal inference, and the other critically examines this reasoning for logical flaws. When disagreements arise, agents attempt to persuade each other, challenging each other's logic and revising their conclusions until they converge on a mutually agreed answer. To take advantage of this deliberative process, we specifically use reasoning language models, whose strengths in both causal inference and adversarial debate remain under-explored relative to standard large language models. We evaluate our approach on the CLadder dataset, a benchmark linking natural language questions to formally defined causal graphs across all three rungs of Pearl's ladder of causation. With Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 as debater agents, we demonstrate that multi-agent debate improves DeepSeek-R1's overall accuracy in causal inference from 78.03% to 87.45%, with the counterfactual category specifically improving from 67.94% to 80.04% accuracy. Similarly, Qwen3's overall accuracy improves from 84.16% to 89.41%, and counterfactual questions from 71.53% to 80.35%, showing that strong models can still benefit greatly from debate with weaker agents. Our results highlight the potential of reasoning models as building blocks for multi-agent systems in causal inference, and demonstrate the importance of diverse perspectives in causal problem-solving.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Numerous graph neural network (GNN)-based algorithms have been proposed to solve graph-based combinatorial optimization problems (COPs), but methods to explain their predictions remain largely undeveloped. We introduce ARM-Explainer, a post-hoc, model-level explainer based on association rule mining, and demonstrate it on the predictions of the hybrid geometric scattering (HGS) GNN for the maximum clique problem (MCP), a canonical NP-hard graph-based COP. The eight most explanatory association rules discovered by ARM-Explainer achieve high median lift and confidence values of 2.42 and 0.49, respectively, on test instances from the TWITTER and BHOSLIB-DIMACS benchmark datasets. ARM-Explainer identifies the most important node features, together with their value ranges, that influence the GNN's predictions on these datasets. Furthermore, augmenting the GNN with informative node features substantially improves its performance on the MCP, increasing the median largest-found clique size by 22% (from 29.5 to 36) on large graphs from the BHOSLIB-DIMACS dataset.

Abstract: As cities around the world aim to improve walkability and safety, understanding the irregular and unpredictable nature of pedestrian behavior has become increasingly important. This study introduces a data-driven framework for modeling chaotic pedestrian movement using empirically observed trajectory data and supervised learning. Videos were recorded during both daytime and nighttime conditions to capture pedestrian dynamics under varying ambient and traffic contexts. Pedestrian trajectories were extracted through computer vision techniques, and behavioral chaos was quantified using four chaos metrics: Approximate Entropy and Lyapunov Exponent, each computed for both velocity and direction change. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was then applied to consolidate these indicators into a unified chaos score. A comprehensive set of individual, group-level, and contextual traffic features was engineered and used to train Random Forest and CatBoost regression models. CatBoost models consistently achieved superior performance. The best daytime PCA-based CatBoost model reached an R^2 of 0.8319, while the nighttime PCA-based CatBoost model attained an R^2 of 0.8574. SHAP analysis highlighted that features such as distance travel, movement duration, and speed variability were robust contributors to chaotic behavior. The proposed framework enables practitioners to quantify and anticipate behavioral instability in real-world settings. Planners and engineers can use chaos scores to identify high-risk pedestrian zones, apprise infrastructure improvements, and calibrate realistic microsimulation models. The approach also supports adaptive risk assessment in automated vehicle systems by capturing short-term motion unpredictability grounded in observable, interpretable features.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) enhance reasoning ability of LLMs by providing step-level supervision. However, their widespread adoption is limited due to expensive manual step-level annotation and poor generalization of static training data to novel errors. We introduce Adversarially Trained PRMs (\texttt{APRM}), where a Generator ($G$) learns to produce reasoning errors to deceive a PRM ($R$), while $R$ concurrently learns to detect them. This interaction yields progressively harder negatives for $R$, improving its robustness and generalization to novel errors without requiring manual step-level labels. Averaged across diverse mathematical reasoning benchmarks, \texttt{APRM} improves solver accuracy by $+3.4$ percentage points (pp) over the strongest PRM baseline. \texttt{APRM} achieves gains of $+5.3$ pp on out-of-distribution tasks.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis plays a vital role in the early detection, monitoring, and management of various cardiovascular conditions. While existing models have achieved notable success in ECG interpretation, they fail to leverage the interrelated nature of various cardiac abnormalities. Conversely, developing a specific model capable of extracting all relevant features for multiple ECG tasks remains a significant challenge. Large-scale foundation models, though powerful, are not typically pretrained on ECG data, making full re-training or fine-tuning computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose EnECG(Mixture of Experts-based Ensemble Learning for ECG Multi-tasks), an ensemble-based framework that integrates multiple specialized foundation models, each excelling in different aspects of ECG interpretation. Instead of relying on a single model or single task, EnECG leverages the strengths of multiple specialized models to tackle a variety of ECG-based tasks. To mitigate the high computational cost of full re-training or fine-tuning, we introduce a lightweight adaptation strategy: attaching dedicated output layers to each foundation model and applying Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) only to these newly added parameters. We then adopt a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to learn ensemble weights, effectively combining the complementary expertise of individual models. Our experimental results demonstrate that by minimizing the scope of fine-tuning, EnECG can help reduce computational and memory costs while maintaining the strong representational power of foundation models. This framework not only enhances feature extraction and predictive performance but also ensures practical efficiency for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to dynamical systems modeling, particularly in hydrodynamics, where traditional solvers often struggle with nonlinearity and computational cost. Lagrangian neural surrogates such as GNS and SEGNN have emerged as strong alternatives by learning from particle-based simulations. However, these models typically operate with limited receptive fields, making them inaccurate for capturing the inherently global interactions in fluid flows. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Convolutional Residual Global Interactions (CORGI), a hybrid architecture that augments any GNN-based solver with a lightweight Eulerian component for global context aggregation. By projecting particle features onto a grid, applying convolutional updates, and mapping them back to the particle domain, CORGI captures long-range dependencies without significant overhead. When applied to a GNS backbone, CORGI achieves a 57% improvement in rollout accuracy with only 13% more inference time and 31% more training time. Compared to SEGNN, CORGI improves accuracy by 49% while reducing inference time by 48% and training time by 30%. Even under identical runtime constraints, CORGI outperforms GNS by 47% on average, highlighting its versatility and performance on varied compute budgets.

Abstract: Traditional curriculum learning proceeds from easy to hard samples, yet defining a reliable notion of difficulty remains elusive. Prior work has used submodular functions to induce difficulty scores in curriculum learning. We reinterpret adaptive subset selection and formulate it as a multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm corresponds to a submodular function guiding sample selection. We introduce ONLINESUBMOD, a novel online greedy policy that optimizes a utility-driven reward and provably achieves no-regret performance under various sampling regimes. Empirically, ONLINESUBMOD outperforms both traditional curriculum learning and bi-level optimization approaches across vision and language datasets, showing superior accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. More broadly, we show that validationdriven reward metrics offer a principled way to guide the curriculum schedule.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of increased model sizes which leads to additional computational burden. Mixture of Experts (MoEs) overcome this bottleneck by decoupling model capacity from computation by only activating a subset of parameters or "experts". However, these models require joint pretraining of these experts along with the router and do not model multi-step reasoning. In contrast, multi-agent frameworks improve reasoning by decomposing complex problems into modular subtasks. However, these frameworks rely on sequential "plan--act--observe" loops, which introduce significant latency. Our work, Comp-LLM, addresses these challenges by introducing a composable inference framework that enables cross-expert collaboration via an explicit sub-query dependency graph. Comp-LLM consists of three components: (1) A Sub-query Generator that decomposes an input query, assigns each sub-query to an appropriate expert using embedding similarity, and constructs a dependency graph; (2) A Query Executor that processes nodes in the graph and identifies opportunities for parallelism based on dependencies and resource constraints; and (3) A Response Aggregator that synthesizes intermediate expert responses into a coherent final answer. Across several benchmarks, Comp-LLM achieves up to 11.01% accuracy improvement over monolithic LLMs of similar size, while offering 1.67x--3.56x reduction in model size with no significant degradation relative to the largest model in its family. Additionally, Comp-LLM provides 1.1x--1.7x latency improvement compared to sequential sub-query processing.

Conclusion: FUSE提供了一个统一且高效的框架来处理高维和非欧几里得数据的中心性度量问题，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Measuring how central or typical a data point is underpins robust estimation, ranking, and outlier detection, but classical depth notions become expensive and unstable in high dimensions and are hard to extend beyond Euclidean data. We introduce Fused Unified centrality Score Estimation (FUSE), a neural centrality framework that operates on top of arbitrary representations. FUSE combines a global head, trained from pairwise distance-based comparisons to learn an anchor-free centrality score, with a local head, trained by denoising score matching to approximate a smoothed log-density potential. A single parameter between 0 and 1 interpolates between these calibrated signals, yielding depth-like centrality from different views via one forward pass. Across synthetic distributions, real images, time series, and text data, and standard outlier detection benchmarks, FUSE recovers meaningful classical ordering, reveals multi-scale geometric structures, and attains competitive performance with strong classical baselines while remaining simple and efficient.

Abstract: We study automated intrusion prediction in an IT system using statistical learning methods. The focus is on developing online attack predictors that detect attacks in real time and identify the current stage of the attack. While such predictors have been proposed in the recent literature, these works typically rely on constructing a monolithic predictor tailored to a specific attack type and scenario. Given that hundreds of attack types are cataloged in the MITRE framework, training a separate monolithic predictor for each of them is infeasible. In this paper, we propose a modular framework for rapidly assembling online attack predictors from reusable components. The modular nature of a predictor facilitates controlling key metrics like timeliness and accuracy of prediction, as well as tuning the trade-off between them. Using public datasets for training and evaluation, we provide many examples of modular predictors and show how an effective predictor can be dynamically assembled during training from a network of modular components.

Abstract: Explaining online time series monitoring models is crucial across sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, where temporal and contextual prediction dynamics underpin critical decisions. While recent XAI methods have improved the explainability of time series models, they mostly analyze each time step independently, overlooking temporal dependencies. This results in further challenges: explaining prediction changes is non-trivial, methods fail to leverage online dynamics, and evaluation remains difficult. To address these challenges, we propose Delta-XAI, which adapts 14 existing XAI methods through a wrapper function and introduces a principled evaluation suite for the online setting, assessing diverse aspects, such as faithfulness, sufficiency, and coherence. Experiments reveal that classical gradient-based methods, such as Integrated Gradients (IG), can outperform recent approaches when adapted for temporal analysis. Building on this, we propose Shifted Window Integrated Gradients (SWING), which incorporates past observations in the integration path to systematically capture temporal dependencies and mitigate out-of-distribution effects. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of SWING across diverse settings with respect to diverse metrics. Our code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Delta-XAI.

Abstract: Pretrained transformers provide rich, general-purpose embeddings, which are transferred to downstream tasks. However, current transfer strategies: fine-tuning and probing, either distort the pretrained geometric structure of the embeddings or lack sufficient expressivity to capture task-relevant signals. These issues become even more pronounced when supervised data are scarce. Here, we introduce Freeze, Diffuse, Decode (FDD), a novel diffusion-based framework that adapts pre-trained embeddings to downstream tasks while preserving their underlying geometric structure. FDD propagates supervised signal along the intrinsic manifold of frozen embeddings, enabling a geometry-aware adaptation of the embedding space. Applied to antimicrobial peptide design, FDD yields low-dimensional, predictive, and interpretable representations that support property prediction, retrieval, and latent-space interpolation.

Abstract: Laser dicing of semiconductor wafers is a critical step in microelectronic manufacturing, where multiple sequential laser passes precisely separate individual dies from the wafer. Adapting this complex sequential process to new wafer materials typically requires weeks of expert effort to balance process speed, separation quality, and material integrity. We present the first automated discovery of production-ready laser dicing processes on an industrial LASER1205 dicing system. We formulate the problem as a high-dimensional, constrained multi-objective Bayesian optimization task, and introduce a sequential two-level fidelity strategy to minimize expensive destructive die-strength evaluations. On bare silicon and product wafers, our method autonomously delivers feasible configurations that match or exceed expert baselines in production speed, die strength, and structural integrity, using only technician-level operation. Post-hoc validation of different weight configurations of the utility functions reveals that multiple feasible solutions with qualitatively different trade-offs can be obtained from the final surrogate model. Expert-refinement of the discovered process can further improve production speed while preserving die strength and structural integrity, surpassing purely manual or automated methods.

Abstract: EEG and audio are inherently distinct modalities, differing in sampling rate, channel structure, and scale. Yet, we show that pretrained neural audio codecs can serve as effective starting points for EEG compression, provided that the data are preprocessed to be suitable to the codec's input constraints. Using DAC, a state-of-the-art neural audio codec as our base, we demonstrate that raw EEG can be mapped into the codec's stride-based framing, enabling direct reuse of the audio-pretrained encoder-decoder. Even without modification, this setup yields stable EEG reconstructions, and fine-tuning on EEG data further improves fidelity and generalization compared to training from scratch. We systematically explore compression-quality trade-offs by varying residual codebook depth, codebook (vocabulary) size, and input sampling rate. To capture spatial dependencies across electrodes, we propose DAC-MC, a multi-channel extension with attention-based cross-channel aggregation and channel-specific decoding, while retaining the audio-pretrained initialization. Evaluations on the TUH Abnormal and Epilepsy datasets show that the adapted codecs preserve clinically relevant information, as reflected in spectrogram-based reconstruction loss and downstream classification accuracy.

Abstract: We analyze the HyperCube model, an \textit{operator-valued} tensor factorization architecture that discovers group structures and their unitary representations. We provide a rigorous theoretical explanation for this inductive bias by decomposing its objective into a term regulating factor scales ($\mathcal{B}$) and a term enforcing directional alignment ($\mathcal{R} \geq 0$). This decomposition isolates the \textit{collinear manifold} ($\mathcal{R}=0$), to which numerical optimization consistently converges for group isotopes. We prove that this manifold admits feasible solutions exclusively for group isotopes, and that within it, $\mathcal{B}$ exerts a variational pressure toward unitarity. To bridge the gap to the global landscape, we formulate a \textit{Collinearity Dominance Conjecture}, supported by empirical observations. Conditional on this dominance, we prove two key results: (1) the global minimum is achieved by the unitary regular representation for groups, and (2) non-group operations incur a strictly higher objective value, formally quantifying the model's inductive bias toward the associative structure of groups (up to isotopy).

Abstract: Event-related potentials (ERP) are measurements of brain activity with wide applications in basic and clinical neuroscience, that are typically estimated using the average of many trials of electroencephalography signals (EEG) to sufficiently reduce noise and signal variability. We introduce EEG2ERP, a novel uncertainty-aware autoencoder approach that maps an arbitrary number of EEG trials to their associated ERP. To account for the ERP uncertainty we use bootstrapped training targets and introduce a separate variance decoder to model the uncertainty of the estimated ERP. We evaluate our approach in the challenging zero-shot scenario of generalizing to new subjects considering three different publicly available data sources; i) the comprehensive ERP CORE dataset that includes over 50,000 EEG trials across six ERP paradigms from 40 subjects, ii) the large P300 Speller BCI dataset, and iii) a neuroimaging dataset on face perception consisting of both EEG and magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We consistently find that our method in the few trial regime provides substantially better ERP estimates than commonly used conventional and robust averaging procedures. EEG2ERP is the first deep learning approach to map EEG signals to their associated ERP, moving toward reducing the number of trials necessary for ERP research.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision Transformers (ViTs) on energy-constrained devices requires evaluation methods that go beyond accuracy alone. We present a two-stage pipeline for assessing ViT energy efficiency that combines device-agnostic model selection with device-related measurements. We benchmark 13 ViT models on ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-10, running inference on NVIDIA Jetson TX2 (edge device) and an NVIDIA RTX 3050 (mobile GPU). The device-agnostic stage uses the NetScore metric for screening; the device-related stage ranks models with the Sustainable Accuracy Metric (SAM). Results show that hybrid models such as LeViT_Conv_192 reduce energy by up to 53% on TX2 relative to a ViT baseline (e.g., SAM5=1.44 on TX2/CIFAR-10), while distilled models such as TinyViT-11M_Distilled excel on the mobile GPU (e.g., SAM5=1.72 on RTX 3050/CIFAR-10 and SAM5=0.76 on RTX 3050/ImageNet-1K).

Abstract: Irregularly sampled time series with substantial missing observations are common in healthcare and sensor networks. We introduce SDE-Attention, a family of SDE-RNNs equipped with channel-level attention on the latent pre-RNN state, including channel recalibration, time-varying feature attention, and pyramidal multi-scale self-attention. We therefore conduct a comparison on a synthetic periodic dataset and real-world benchmarks, under varying missing rate. Latent-space attention consistently improves over a vanilla SDE-RNN. On the univariate UCR datasets, the LSTM-based time-varying feature model SDE-TVF-L achieves the highest average accuracy, raising mean performance by approximately 4, 6, and 10 percentage points over the baseline at 30%, 60% and 90% missingness, respectively (averaged across datasets). On multivariate UEA benchmarks, attention-augmented models again outperform the backbone, with SDE-TVF-L yielding up to a 7% gain in mean accuracy under high missingness. Among the proposed mechanisms, time-varying feature attention is the most robust on univariate datasets. On multivariate datasets, different attention types excel on different tasks, showing that SDE-Attention can be flexibly adapted to the structure of each problem.

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across various applications, especially in handling sequential data such as natural languages and time series. However, transformer models often lack clear interpretability, and the success of transformers has not been well understood in theory. In this paper, we study the capability and interpretability of transformers in learning a family of classic statistical models, namely random walks on circles. We theoretically demonstrate that, after training with gradient descent, a one-layer transformer model can achieve optimal accuracy in predicting random walks. Importantly, our analysis reveals that the trained model is interpretable: the trained softmax attention serves as a token selector, focusing on the direct parent state; subsequently, the value matrix executes a one-step probability transition to predict the location of the next state based on this parent state. We also show that certain edge cases not covered by our theory are indeed failure cases, demonstrating that our theoretical conditions are tight. By investigating these success and failure cases, it is revealed that gradient descent with small initialization may fail or struggle to converge to a good solution in certain simple tasks even beyond random walks. Experiments are conducted to support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Traditional and modern machine learning-based path loss models typically assume a constant prediction variance. We propose a neural network that jointly predicts the mean and link-specific variance by minimizing a Gaussian negative log-likelihood, enabling heteroscedastic uncertainty estimates. We compare shared, partially shared, and independent-parameter architectures using accuracy, calibration, and sharpness metrics on blind test sets from large public RF drive-test datasets. The shared-parameter architecture performs best, achieving an RMSE of 7.4 dB, 95.1 percent coverage for 95 percent prediction intervals, and a mean interval width of 29.6 dB. These uncertainty estimates further support link-specific coverage margins, improve RF planning and interference analyses, and provide effective self-diagnostics of model weaknesses.

Abstract: Deep neural network-based time series prediction models have recently demonstrated superior capabilities in capturing complex temporal dependencies. However, it is challenging for these models to account for uncertainty associated with their predictions, because they directly output scalar values at each time step. To address such a challenge, we propose a novel model named interleaved dual-branch Probability Distribution Network (interPDN), which directly constructs discrete probability distributions per step instead of a scalar. The regression output at each time step is derived by computing the expectation of the predictive distribution on a predefined support set. To mitigate prediction anomalies, a dual-branch architecture is introduced with interleaved support sets, augmented by coarse temporal-scale branches for long-term trend forecasting. Outputs from another branch are treated as auxiliary signals to impose self-supervised consistency constraints on the current branch's prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of interPDN.

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical performances of Spectral Clustering, a classical algorithm for graph partitioning that relies on the eigenvectors of a matrix representation of the graph. Informally, we show that Spectral Clustering works well as long as the smallest eigenvalues appear in groups well separated from the rest of the matrix representation's spectrum. This arises, for example, whenever there exists a hierarchy of clusters at different scales, a regime not captured by previous analyses. Our results are very general and can be applied beyond the traditional graph Laplacian. In particular, we study Hermitian representations of digraphs and show Spectral Clustering can recover partitions where edges between clusters are oriented mostly in the same direction. This has applications in, for example, the analysis of trophic levels in ecological networks. We demonstrate that our results accurately predict the performances of Spectral Clustering on synthetic and real-world data sets.

Abstract: Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.

Abstract: Effective surveillance of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) requires forecasts accounting for epidemiological patterns and contextual drivers like school calendars and weather. While classical models and recent foundation models (e.g., Chronos, TimesFM) incorporate covariates, they often lack the semantic reasoning to interpret the causal interplay between conflicting drivers. In this work, we propose a two-agent framework decoupling contextual interpretation from probabilistic forecasting. An LLM "event interpreter" processes heterogeneous signals-including school schedules, meteorological summaries, and reports-into a scalar transmission-impact signal. A neuro-symbolic core then combines this with historical case counts to produce calibrated probabilistic forecasts. We evaluate the framework on real-world HFMD datasets from Hong Kong (2023-2024) and Lishui, China (2024). Compared to traditional and foundation-model baselines, our approach achieves competitive point forecasting accuracy while providing robust 90% prediction intervals (coverage 0.85-1.00) and human-interpretable rationales. Our results suggest that structurally integrating domain knowledge through LLMs can match state-of-the-art performance while yielding context-aware forecasts that align with public health workflows.

Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).

Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for physics-informed learning in complex cyber-physical systems governed by differential equations with both unknown dynamics and algebraic invariants. First, we formalize the Hybrid Recurrent Physics-Informed Neural Network (HRPINN), a general-purpose architecture that embeds known physics as a hard structural constraint within a recurrent integrator to learn only residual dynamics. Second, we introduce the Projected HRPINN (PHRPINN), a novel extension that integrates a predict-project mechanism to strictly enforce algebraic invariants by design. The framework is supported by a theoretical analysis of its representational capacity. We validate HRPINN on a real-world battery prognostics DAE and evaluate PHRPINN on a suite of standard constrained benchmarks. The results demonstrate the framework's potential for achieving high accuracy and data efficiency, while also highlighting critical trade-offs between physical consistency, computational cost, and numerical stability, providing practical guidance for its deployment.

Abstract: A clearer understanding of when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly sought in order to characterize the dynamics of multi-agent learning systems. We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.

Abstract: An associative memory (AM) enables cue-response recall, and it has recently been recognized as a key mechanism underlying modern neural architectures such as Transformers. In this work, we introduce the concept of distributed dynamic associative memory (DDAM), which extends classical AM to settings with multiple agents and time-varying data streams. In DDAM, each agent maintains a local AM that must not only store its own associations but also selectively memorize information from other agents based on a specified interest matrix. To address this problem, we propose a novel tree-based distributed online gradient descent algorithm, termed DDAM-TOGD, which enables each agent to update its memory on the fly via inter-agent communication over designated routing trees. We derive rigorous performance guarantees for DDAM-TOGD, proving sublinear static regret in stationary environments and a path-length dependent dynamic regret bound in non-stationary environments. These theoretical results provide insights into how communication delays and network structure impact performance. Building on the regret analysis, we further introduce a combinatorial tree design strategy that optimizes the routing trees to minimize communication delays, thereby improving regret bounds. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DDAM-TOGD framework achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to representative online learning baselines such as consensus-based distributed optimization, confirming the benefits of the proposed approach in dynamic, distributed environments.

Abstract: We study the online unweighted bipartite matching problem in the random arrival order model, with $n$ offline and $n$ online vertices, in the learning-augmented setting: The algorithm is provided with untrusted predictions of the types (neighborhoods) of the online vertices. We build upon the work of Choo et al. (ICML 2024, pp. 8762-8781) who proposed an approach that uses a prefix of the arrival sequence as a sample to determine whether the predictions are close to the true arrival sequence and then either follows the predictions or uses a known baseline algorithm that ignores the predictions and is $β$-competitive. Their analysis is limited to the case that the optimal matching has size $n$, i.e., every online vertex can be matched. We generalize their approach and analysis by removing any assumptions on the size of the optimal matching while only requiring that the size of the predicted matching is at least $αn$ for any constant $0 < α\le 1$. Our learning-augmented algorithm achieves $(1-o(1))$-consistency and $(β-o(1))$-robustness. Additionally, we show that the competitive ratio degrades smoothly between consistency and robustness with increasing prediction error.

Abstract: Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we present a new multimodal model structure that incorporates a learning-based data compression method, which compresses model embeddings into low-bit integers while preserving the model's performance, greatly reducing the transmission costs between partitions. We then determine the optimal number of discrete representation levels based on a solid theoretical foundation from entropy coding.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal policies from pre-collected datasets. However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.

Abstract: Inverse heat problems refer to the estimation of material thermophysical properties given observed or known heat diffusion behaviour. Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.

Abstract: Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benchmarks to date. We find that the price for a given level of benchmark performance has decreased remarkably fast, around $5\times$ to $10\times$ per year, for frontier models on knowledge, reasoning, math, and software engineering benchmarks. These reductions in the cost of AI inference are due to economic forces, hardware efficiency improvements, and algorithmic efficiency improvements. Isolating out open models to control for competition effects and dividing by hardware price declines, we estimate that algorithmic efficiency progress is around $3\times$ per year. Finally, we recommend that evaluators both publicize and take into account the price of benchmarking as an essential part of measuring the real-world impact of AI.

Abstract: Current world models lack a unified and controlled setting for systematic evaluation, making it difficult to assess whether they truly capture the underlying rules that govern environment dynamics. In this work, we address this open challenge by introducing the SmallWorld Benchmark, a testbed designed to assess world model capability under isolated and precisely controlled dynamics without relying on handcrafted reward signals. Using this benchmark, we conduct comprehensive experiments in the fully observable state space on representative architectures including Recurrent State Space Model, Transformer, Diffusion model, and Neural ODE, examining their behavior across six distinct domains. The experimental results reveal how effectively these models capture environment structure and how their predictions deteriorate over extended rollouts, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of current modeling paradigms and offering insights into future improvement directions in representation learning and dynamics modeling.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In an age where sustainability is of paramount importance, the significance of both high-performance computing and intelligent algorithms cannot be understated. Yet, these domains often demand hefty computational power, translating to substantial energy usage and potentially sidelining less robust computing systems. It's evident that we need an approach that is more encompassing, scalable, and eco-friendly for intelligent algorithm development and implementation. The strategy we present in this paper offers a compelling answer to these issues. We unveil a fresh framework that seamlessly melds high-performance cluster computing with intelligent algorithms, all within a blockchain infrastructure. This promotes both efficiency and a broad-based participation. At its core, our design integrates an evolved proof-of-work consensus process, which links computational efforts directly to rewards for producing blocks. This ensures both optimal resource use and participation from a wide spectrum of computational capacities. Additionally, our approach incorporates a dynamic 'trust rating' that evolves based on a track record of accurate block validations. This rating determines the likelihood of a node being chosen for block generation, creating a merit-based system that recognizes and rewards genuine and precise contributions. To level the playing field further, we suggest a statistical 'draw' system, allowing even less powerful nodes a chance to be part of the block creation process.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit the relationship between two fundamental models of distributed computation: the asynchronous message-passing model with up to $f$ crash failures ($\operatorname{AMP}_f$) and the Heard-Of model with up to $f$ message omissions ($\operatorname{HO}_f$). We show that for $n > 2f$, the two models are equivalent with respect to the solvability of colorless tasks, and that for colored tasks the equivalence holds only when $f = 1$ (and $n > 2$). The separation for larger $f$ arises from the presence of silenced processes in $\operatorname{HO}_f$, which may lead to incompatible decisions. The proofs proceed through bidirectional simulations between $\operatorname{AMP}_f$ and $\operatorname{HO}_f$ via an intermediate model that captures this notion of silencing. The results extend to randomized protocols against a non-adaptive adversary, indicating that the expressive limits of canonical rounds are structural rather than probabilistic. Together, these results delineate precisely where round-based abstractions capture asynchronous computation, and where they do not.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in both latency-sensitive online services and cost-sensitive offline workloads. Co-locating these workloads on shared serving instances can improve resource utilization, but directly applying this approach to Prefill/Decode (P/D) disaggregated systems introduces severe load imbalance, as fluctuating request mixes alter the intrinsic P/D ratio. Existing dynamic adjustment techniques cannot keep up with the bursty traffic patterns of online services.
  We propose a latency-constraint disaggregated architecture, which separates cluster resources into latency-strict and latency-relaxed pools based on task latency requirements. This design enables flexible placement of offline decode tasks, mitigating P/D imbalance while preserving online performance. To fully exploit this flexibility, we propose (1) a bottleneck-based scheduler guided by a Roofline-based performance model for performance bottleneck based scheduling, and (2) a fast preemption mechanism that strictly enforces Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for online requests.
  Experiments on real-world traces show that compared to existing offline system approaches, our method improves offline throughput by up to 3x, while maintaining online request SLOs.

Abstract: Cache replacement algorithms are critical building blocks of storage systems. This paper examines the characteristics of metadata caches and argues that they inherently exhibit correlated references, even when the corresponding data accesses do not contain correlated references. The presence of correlated references reduces the effectiveness of cache replacement algorithms because these references are often mistakenly categorized as hot blocks. Clock2Q+ is specifically designed for metadata caches and has been implemented in vSAN and VDFS, two flagship storage products of VMware by Broadcom. Similar to S3-FIFO, Clock2Q+ uses three queues; however, Clock2Q+ introduces a correlation window in the Small FIFO queue, where blocks in this window do not set the reference bit. This simple enhancement allows Clock2Q+ to outperform state-of-the-art replacement algorithms. Compared to S3-FIFO, the second-best performing algorithm, Clock2Q+ achieves up to a 28.5% lower miss ratio on metadata traces. Clock2Q+ possesses the essential properties required for large-scale storage systems: it has low CPU overhead on cache hits, low memory overhead, scales efficiently to multiple CPUs, and is both easy to tune and implement. Additionally, Clock2Q+ outperforms state-of-the-art cache replacement algorithms on data traces as well.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Model (LLM) services at the edge benefits latency-sensitive and privacy-aware applications. However, the stateless nature of LLMs makes managing user context (e.g., sessions, preferences) across geo-distributed edge nodes challenging. Existing solutions, such as client-side context storage, often introduce network latency and bandwidth overhead, undermining the advantages of edge deployment.
  We propose DisCEdge, a distributed context management system that stores and replicates user context in tokenized form across edge nodes. By maintaining context as token sequences rather than raw text, our system avoids redundant computation and enables efficient data replication. We implement and evaluate an open-source prototype in a realistic edge environment with commodity hardware. We show DisCEdge improves median response times by up to 14.46% and lowers median inter-node synchronization overhead by up to 15% compared to a raw-text-based system. It also reduces client request sizes by a median of 90% compared to client-side context management, while guaranteeing data consistency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Modern distributed systems replicate data across multiple execution sites. Business requirements and resource constraints often necessitate mixing different languages across replica sites. To facilitate the management of replicated data, modern software engineering practices integrate special-purpose replicated data libraries (RDLs) that provide read-write access to the data and ensure its synchronization. Irrespective of the implementation languages, an RDL typically uses a single language or offers bindings to a designated one. Hence, integrating existing RDLs in multilingual environments requires special-purpose code, whose software quality and performance characteristics are poorly understood.
  AIMS: We aim to bridge this knowledge gap to understand the software quality and performance characteristics of RDL integration in multilingual environments.
  METHOD: We conduct an empirical study of two key strategies for integrating RDLs in the context of multilingual replicated data systems: foreign-function interface (FFI) and a common data format (CDF); we measure and compare their respective software metrics and performance to understand their suitability for the task at hand.
  RESULTS: Our results reveal that adopting CDF for cross-language interaction offers software quality, latency, memory consumption, and throughput advantages. We further validate our findings by (1) creating a CDF-based RDL for mixing compiled, interpreted, and managed languages; and (2) enhancing our RDL with plug-in extensibility that enables adding functionality in a single language while maintaining integration within a multilingual environment.
  CONCLUSIONS: With modern distributed systems utilizing multiple languages, our findings provide novel insights for designing RDLs in multilingual replicated data systems.

Abstract: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.
  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.

Abstract: Work on the development of optimal fault-tolerant Agreement protocols using the logic of knowledge has concentrated on the "full information" approach to information exchange, which is costly with respect to message size. Alpturer, Halpern, and van der Meyden (PODC 2023) introduced the notion of optimality with respect to a limited information exchange, and studied the Eventual Agreement problem in the sending omissions failure model. The present paper studies the Simultaneous Agreement problem for the crash failures model, and a number of limited information exchanges from the literature. In particular, the paper considers information exchanges from a FloodSet protocol (Lynch, Distributed Algorithms 1996), a variant of this in which agents also count the number of failures (Castañeda et al, NETYS 2017), and a variant in which agents associate each agent with a value (Raynal, PRDC 2002). A new information exchange is also introduced that enables decisions to be made at worst one round later than the optimal protocol of Dwork and Moses (I&C 88), but with lower computation cost and space requirements. By determining implementations of a knowledge based program, protocols are derived that are optimal amongst protocols for each of these information exchanges.

Abstract: Large Language Models drive a wide range of modern AI applications but impose substantial challenges on large-scale serving systems due to intensive computation, strict latency constraints, and throughput bottlenecks. We introduce OmniInfer, a unified system-level acceleration framework designed to maximize end-to-end serving efficiency through fine-grained optimization of expert placement, cache compression, and scheduling. OmniInfer integrates three complementary components: OmniPlacement for load-aware Mixture-of-Experts scheduling, OmniAttn for sparse attention acceleration, and OmniProxy for disaggregation-aware request scheduling. Built atop vLLM, OmniInfer delivers system-wide performance gains through adaptive resource disaggregation, efficient sparsity exploitation, and global coordination across prefill and decode phases. Evaluated on DeepSeek-R1 within a 10-node Ascend 910C cluster, OmniInfer achieves 616 QPM, where the unified framework reduces TPOT by 36\%, and the superimposition of OmniProxy further slashes TTFT by 38\%.

Abstract: Significance: Monte Carlo (MC) methods are the gold-standard for modeling light-tissue interactions due to their accuracy. Mesh-based MC (MMC) offers enhanced precision for complex tissue structures using tetrahedral mesh models. Despite significant speedups achieved on graphics processing units (GPUs), MMC performance remains hindered by the computational cost of frequent ray-boundary intersection tests.
  Aim: We propose a highly accelerated MMC algorithm, RT-MMC, that leverages the hardware-accelerated ray traversal and intersection capabilities of ray-tracing cores (RT-cores) on modern GPUs.
  Approach: Implemented using NVIDIA's OptiX platform, RT-MMC extends graphics ray-tracing pipelines towards volumetric ray-tracing in turbid media, eliminating the need for challenging tetrahedral mesh generation while delivering significant speed improvements through hardware acceleration. It also intrinsically supports wide-field sources without complex mesh retesselation.
  Results: RT-MMC demonstrates excellent agreement with traditional software-ray-tracing MMC algorithms while achieving 1.5x to 4.5x speedups across multiple GPU architectures. These performance gains significantly enhance the practicality of MMC for routine simulations.
  Conclusion: Migration from software- to hardware-based ray-tracing not only greatly simplifies MMC simulation workflows, but also results in significant speedups that are expected to increase further as ray-tracing hardware rapidly gains adoption. Adoption of graphics ray-tracing pipelines in quantitative MMC simulations enables leveraging of emerging hardware resources and benefits a wide range of biophotonics applications.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the de facto method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs), enabling rapid adaptation to diverse domains. In production, LoRA-based models are served at scale, creating multi-tenant environments with hundreds of adapters sharing a base model. However, state-of-the-art serving systems co-batch heterogeneous adapters without accounting for rank (size) variability, leading to severe performance skew, which ultimately requires adding more GPUs to satisfy service-level objectives (SLOs). Existing optimizations, focused on loading, caching, and kernel execution, ignore this heterogeneity, leaving GPU resources underutilized. We present LoRAServe, a workload-aware dynamic adapter placement and routing framework designed to tame rank diversity in LoRA serving. By dynamically rebalancing adapters across GPUs and leveraging GPU Direct RDMA for remote access, LoRAServe maximizes throughput and minimizes tail latency under real-world workload drift. Evaluations on production traces from Company X show that LoRAServe elicits up to 2$\times$ higher throughput, up to 9$\times$ lower TTFT, while using up to 50% fewer GPUs under SLO constraints compared to state-of-the-art systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present Areon, a family of latency-friendly, stake-weighted, multi-proposer proof-of-stake consensus protocols. By allowing multiple proposers per slot and organizing blocks into a directed acyclic graph (DAG), Areon achieves robustness under partial synchrony. Blocks reference each other within a sliding window, forming maximal antichains that represent parallel ``votes'' on history. Conflicting subDAGs are resolved by a closest common ancestor (CCA)-local, window-filtered fork choice that compares the weight of each subDAG -- the number of recent short references -- and prefers the heavier one. Combined with a structural invariant we call Tip-Boundedness (TB), this yields a bounded-width frontier and allows honest work to aggregate quickly.
  We formalize an idealized protocol (Areon-Ideal) that abstracts away network delay and reference bounds, and a practical protocol (Areon-Base) that adds VRF-based eligibility, bounded short and long references, and application-level validity and conflict checks at the block level. On top of DAG analogues of the classical common-prefix, chain-growth, and chain-quality properties, we prove a backbone-style $(k,\varepsilon)$-finality theorem that calibrates confirmation depth as a function of the window length and target tail probability. We focus on consensus at the level of blocks; extending the framework to richer transaction selection, sampling, and redundancy policies is left to future work.
  Finally, we build a discrete-event simulator and compare Areon-Base against a chain-based baseline (Ouroboros Praos) under matched block-arrival rates. Across a wide range of adversarial stakes and network delays, Areon-Base achieves bounded-latency finality with consistently lower reorganization frequency and depth.

Abstract: Split learning (SL) offloads main computing tasks from multiple resource-constrained user equippments (UEs) to the base station (BS), while preserving local data privacy. However, its computation and communication processes remain sequential, resulting in limited system efficiency. To overcome this limitation, this paper applies pipeline parallelism (PP) of distributed training to SL in wireless networks, proposing the so-called communication-computation pipeline parallel split learning (C$^2$P$^2$SL). By considering the communicating and computing processes of UEs and BS as an overall pipeline, C$^2$P$^2$SL achieves pipeline parallelization among different micro-batches which are split from each batch of data samples. The overlap of communication and computation in this way significantly reduces the total training time. Given that training efficiency is affected by position of cutting layer and heterogeneity of the UEs, we formulate a joint optimization problem of task split and resource allocation, and design a solution based on alternating optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that C$^2$P$^2$SL significantly reduces system training time by over 38\% while maintaining convergence accuracy under different communication conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The content-oblivious model, introduced by Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel (PODC 2022; Distributed Computing 2023), captures an extremely weak form of communication where nodes can only send asynchronous, content-less pulses. Censor-Hillel, Cohen, Gelles, and Sel showed that no non-constant function $f(x,y)$ can be computed correctly by two parties using content-oblivious communication over a single edge, where one party holds $x$ and the other holds $y$. This seemingly ruled out many natural graph problems on non-2-edge-connected graphs.
  In this work, we show that, with the knowledge of network topology $G$, leader election is possible in a wide range of graphs.
  Impossibility: Graphs symmetric about an edge admit no randomized terminating leader election algorithm, even when nodes have unique identifiers and full knowledge of $G$.
  Leader election algorithms: Trees that are not symmetric about any edge admit a quiescently terminating leader election algorithm with topology knowledge, even in anonymous networks, using $O(n^2)$ messages, where $n$ is the number of nodes. Moreover, even-diameter trees admit a terminating leader election given only the knowledge of the network diameter $D = 2r$, with message complexity $O(nr)$.
  Necessity of topology knowledge: In the family of graphs $\mathcal{G} = \{P_3, P_5\}$, both the 3-path $P_3$ and the 5-path $P_5$ admit a quiescently terminating leader election if nodes know the topology exactly. However, if nodes only know that the underlying topology belongs to $\mathcal{G}$, then terminating leader election is impossible.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In today's world, the focus of programmers has shifted from writing complex, error-prone code to prioritizing simple, clear, efficient, and sustainable code that makes programs easier to understand. Code refactoring plays a critical role in this transition by improving structural organization and optimizing performance. However, existing refactoring methods are limited in their ability to generalize across multiple programming languages and coding styles, as they often rely on manually crafted transformation rules. The objectives of this study are to (i) develop an Large Language Models (LLMs)-based framework capable of performing accurate and efficient code refactoring across multiple languages (C, C++, C#, Python, Java), (ii) investigate the impact of prompt engineering (Temperature, Different shot algorithm) and instruction fine-tuning on refactoring effectiveness, and (iii) evaluate the quality improvements (Compilability, Correctness, Distance, Similarity, Number of Lines, Token, Character, Cyclomatic Complexity) in refactored code through empirical metrics and human assessment. To accomplish these goals, we propose a fine-tuned prompt-engineering-based model combined with few-shot learning for multilingual code refactoring. Experimental results indicate that Java achieves the highest overall correctness up to 99.99% the 10-shot setting, records the highest average compilability of 94.78% compared to the original source code and maintains high similarity (Approx. 53-54%) and thus demonstrates a strong balance between structural modifications and semantic preservation. Python exhibits the lowest structural distance across all shots (Approx. 277-294) while achieving moderate similarity ( Approx. 44-48%) that indicates consistent and minimally disruptive refactoring.

Abstract: This paper presents an event-chain-driven, LLM-empowered workflow for generating validated, automotive code from natural-language requirements. A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer retrieves relevant signals from large and evolving Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) catalogs as code generation prompt context, reducing hallucinations and ensuring architectural correctness. Retrieved signals are mapped and validated before being transformed into event chains that encode causal and timing constraints. These event chains guide and constrain LLM-based code synthesis, ensuring behavioral consistency and real-time feasibility. Based on our initial findings from the emergency braking case study, with the proposed approach, we managed to achieve valid signal usage and consistent code generation without LLM retraining.

Abstract: Repository-level code translation aims to migrate entire repositories across programming languages while preserving functionality automatically. Despite advancements in repository-level code translation, validating the translations remains challenging. This paper proposes TRAM, which combines context-aware type resolution with mock-based in-isolation validation to achieve high-quality translations between programming languages. Prior to translation, TRAM retrieves API documentation and contextual code information for each variable type in the source language. It then prompts a large language model (LLM) with retrieved contextual information to resolve type mappings across languages with precise semantic interpretations. Using the automatically constructed type mapping, TRAM employs a custom serialization/deserialization workflow that automatically constructs equivalent mock objects in the target language. This enables each method fragment to be validated in isolation, without the high cost of using agents for translation validation, or the heavy manual effort required by existing approaches that rely on language interoperability. TRAM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Java-to-Python translation, underscoring the effectiveness of its integration of RAG-based type resolution with reliable in-isolation validation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As modern science becomes increasingly data-intensive, the ability to analyze and visualize large-scale, complex datasets is critical to accelerating discovery. However, many domain scientists lack the programming expertise required to develop custom data analysis workflows, creating barriers to timely and effective insight. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by generating executable code from natural language descriptions. In this paper, we investigate the trustworthiness of open-source LLMs in autonomously producing Python scripts for scientific data analysis and visualization. We construct a benchmark suite of domain-inspired prompts that reflect real-world research tasks and systematically evaluate the executability and correctness of the generated code. Our findings show that, without human intervention, the reliability of LLM-generated code is limited, with frequent failures caused by ambiguous prompts and the models' insufficient understanding of domain-specific contexts. To address these challenges, we design and assess three complementary strategies: data-aware prompt disambiguation, retrieval-augmented prompt enhancement, and iterative error repair. While these methods significantly improve execution success rates and output quality, further refinement is needed. This work highlights both the promise and current limitations of LLM-driven automation in scientific workflows and introduces actionable techniques and a reusable benchmark for building more inclusive, accessible, and trustworthy AI-assisted research tools.

Abstract: When modernizing a legacy application, it is easy to fall back on a like-for-like replica with new tools and updated design stylings, but this is an opportunity to explore making a more intuitive application that supports user tasks and efficiency. Rather than having a blank canvas-unburdened by legacy tech debt-to create a new application, you are working with an existing application that is integral to accelerator operations and one that expert users are already familiar with. Due to this, you might assume people will prefer the like-for-like, but you could be carrying forward the pain points, processes that are inefficient, and ultimately wind up with an application that no one wants to use because it doesn't solve existing problems. Getting users involved can make all the difference in your approach to modernizing a legacy application that caters to both newer and expert users. It also can bridge the gap between like-for-like and introducing new GUI design. Having a legacy application doesn't have to make the modernized one difficult to develop, as the existing application is a tool in how you move forward with the new application. It provides insight into areas that an application with a clean slate doesn't give you.

Result: 在ApacheJIT基准测试中达到F1=0.64和ROC-AUC=0.89的最优性能，模拟显示仅对风险最高的30%提交进行拦截可防止86.4%的缺陷引入变更

Conclusion: DRS-OSS系统通过API、Web界面和GitHub插件集成到开发工作流中，提供了有效的代码变更风险评估解决方案

Abstract: In large-scale open-source projects, hundreds of pull requests land daily, each a potential source of regressions. Diff Risk Scoring (DRS) estimates the likelihood that a diff will introduce a defect, enabling better review prioritization, test planning, and CI/CD gating. We present DRS-OSS, an open-source DRS system equipped with a public API, web UI, and GitHub plugin. DRS-OSS uses a fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B sequence classifier trained on the ApacheJIT dataset, consuming long-context representations that combine commit messages, structured diffs, and change metrics. Through parameter-efficient adaptation, 4-bit QLoRA, and DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 CPU offloading, we train 22k-token contexts on a single 20 GB GPU. On the ApacheJIT benchmark, DRS-OSS achieves state-of-the-art performance (F1 = 0.64, ROC-AUC = 0.89). Simulations show that gating only the riskiest 30% of commits can prevent up to 86.4% of defect-inducing changes. The system integrates with developer workflows through an API gateway, a React dashboard, and a GitHub App that posts risk labels on pull requests. We release the full replication package, fine-tuning scripts, deployment artifacts, code, demo video, and public website.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inference is both expensive and slow. Local caching of responses offers a practical solution to reduce the cost and latency of LLM queries. In research contexts, caching also enhances reproducibility and provides flexibility for experimentation. However, naive reuse of cached responses compromises statistical independence, a critical property for probabilistic workflows. In applications of LLM for code, it underpins performance metrics such as Pass@k and uncertainty estimation, as well as algorithms like program repair loops and retries. Existing LLM caching systems lack ways to enforce statistical independence constraints. To address this, we introduce Mnimi, a cache design pattern that supports modular LLM workflows while ensuring statistical integrity at the component level. Its core innovation lies in encapsulating statistical constraints within the type of LLM references, allowing users to manage and transform these types according to the scope and requirements of their algorithm. We implemented this design pattern in Python using a combination of decorators and iterators over infinite sequences. A case study on SpecFix, an recent automated program specification repair system, highlights how Mnimi improves reproducibility, ease of debugging, time and cost efficiency while preserving statistical correctness.

Abstract: Security policies, such as SECURITY.md files, are now common in open-source projects. They help guide responsible vulnerability reporting and build trust among users and contributors. Despite their growing use, it is still unclear how these policies influence the structure and evolution of software dependencies. Software dependencies are external packages or libraries that a project relies on, and their interconnected nature affects both functionality and security. This study explores the relationship between security policies and dependency management in PyPI projects. We analyzed projects with and without a SECURITY.md file by examining their dependency trees and tracking how dependencies change over time. The analysis shows that projects with a security policy tend to rely on a broader set of direct dependencies, while overall depth and transitive dependencies remain similar. Historically, projects created after the introduction of SECURITY.md, particularly later adopters, show more frequent dependency updates. These results suggest that security policies are linked to more modular and feature-rich projects, and highlight the role of SECURITY.md in promoting proactive dependency management and reducing risks in the software supply chain.

Abstract: Modern networked systems rely on complex software stacks, which often conceal vulnerabilities arising from intricate interdependencies. A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is effective for identifying dependencies and mitigating security risks. However, existing SBOM solutions lack precision, particularly in binary analysis and non-package-managed languages like C/C++.
  This paper introduces UniBOM, an advanced tool for SBOM generation, analysis, and visualisation, designed to enhance the security accountability of networked systems. UniBOM integrates binary, filesystem, and source code analysis, enabling fine-grained vulnerability detection and risk management. Key features include historical CPE tracking, AI-based vulnerability classification by severity and memory safety, and support for non-package-managed C/C++ dependencies.
  UniBOM's effectiveness is demonstrated through a comparative vulnerability analysis of 258 wireless router firmware binaries and the source code of four popular IoT operating systems, highlighting its superior detection capabilities compared to other widely used SBOM generation and analysis tools. Packaged for open-source distribution, UniBOM offers an end-to-end unified analysis and visualisation solution, advancing SBOM-driven security management for dependable networked systems and broader software.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilised in software engineering, yet their ability to generate structured artefacts such as UML diagrams remains underexplored. In this work we present NOMAD, a cognitively inspired, modular multi-agent framework that decomposes UML generation into a series of role-specialised subtasks. Each agent handles a distinct modelling activity, such as entity extraction, relationship classification, and diagram synthesis, mirroring the goal-directed reasoning processes of an engineer. This decomposition improves interpretability and allows for targeted verification strategies. We evaluate NOMAD through a mixed design: a large case study (Northwind) for in-depth probing and error analysis, and human-authored UML exercises for breadth and realism. NOMAD outperforms all selected baselines, while revealing persistent challenges in fine-grained attribute extraction. Building on these observations, we introduce the first systematic taxonomy of errors in LLM-generated UML diagrams, categorising structural, relationship, and semantic/logical. Finally, we examine verification as a design probe, showing its mixed effects and outlining adaptive strategies as promising directions. Together, these contributions position NOMAD as both an effective framework for UML class diagram generation and a lens onto the broader research challenges of reliable language-to-model workflows.

Abstract: The growing adoption of federated data spaces, such as in the GAIA-X and the International Data Spaces (IDS) initiative, promises secure and sovereign data sharing across organizational boundaries in Industry 4.0. In manufacturing ecosystems, this enables use cases, such as cross-factory process optimization, predictive maintenance, and supplier integration. Frameworks and standards, such as the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC), ID-Link and Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) provide a strong foundation to realize this ecosystem. However, a major open challenge is the practical description and enforcement of context-dependent data usage policies using these base technologies - especially by domain experts without software engineering backgrounds. Therefore, this article proposes a method for leveraging domain-specific languages (DSLs) to enable declarative, human-readable, and machine-executable policy definitions for sovereign data sharing via data space connectors. The DSL empowers domain experts to specify fine-grained data governance requirements - such as restricting access to data from specific production batches or enforcing automatic deletion after a defined retention period - without writing imperative code.

Motivation: 识别那些重复吸引bug的源代码子集对于降低软件长期维护成本具有重要意义。现有研究缺乏对此类极度容易出现bug的方法的大规模系统性分析。

Method: 研究分析了98个开源Java项目中的125万多个方法，定义了'极度buggy方法'的概念，使用五个人工智能模型进行预测分析，并对265个极度buggy方法进行主题分析。

Result: 极度buggy方法在初始创建时就显示出更大规模、更高复杂性、更低可读性和可维护性等特点。然而，早期预测这些方法仍不可靠，主要受到数据不平衡、项目异质性和bug演化特性的影响。

Conclusion: 研究强调了需要开发更丰富的、考虑代码演化的表示方法，并为开发人员在开发生命周期早期识别高风险方法提供了实用的参考建议。

Abstract: Identifying the small subset of source code that repeatedly attracts bugs is critical for reducing long-term maintenance effort. We define ExtremelyBuggy methods as those involved in more than one bug fix and present the first large-scale study of their prevalence, characteristics, and predictability. Using a dataset of over 1.25 million methods from 98 open-source Java projects, we find that ExtremelyBuggy methods constitute only a tiny fraction of all methods, yet frequently account for a disproportionately large share of bugs. At their inception, these methods are significantly larger, more complex, less readable, and less maintainable than both singly-buggy and non-buggy methods. However, despite these measurable differences, a comprehensive evaluation of five machine learning models shows that early prediction of ExtremelyBuggy methods remains highly unreliable due to data imbalance, project heterogeneity, and the fact that many bugs emerge through subsequent evolution rather than initial implementation. To complement these quantitative findings, we conduct a thematic analysis of 265 ExtremelyBuggy methods, revealing recurring visual issues (e.g., confusing control flow, poor readability), contextual roles (e.g., core logic, data transformation, external resource handling), and common defect patterns (e.g., faulty conditionals, fragile error handling, misuse of variables). These results highlight the need for richer, evolution-aware representations of code and provide actionable insights for practitioners seeking to prioritize high-risk methods early in the development lifecycle.

Abstract: Software debugging is a critical and time-consuming aspect of software development, with fault localization being a fundamental step that significantly impacts debugging efficiency. Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) has gained prominence due to its robust theoretical foundations and fine-grained analysis capabilities. However, recent studies have identified a critical challenge: noise phenomena, specifically the false kill relationships between mutants and tests, which significantly degrade localization effectiveness. While several approaches have been proposed to rectify the final localization results, they do not directly address the underlying noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to refine the kill matrix, a core data structure capturing mutant-test relationships in MBFL, by treating it as a signal that contains both meaningful fault-related patterns and high-frequency noise. Inspired by signal processing theory, we introduce DKMR (Denoising-based Kill Matrix Refinement), which employs two key stages: (1) signal enhancement through hybrid matrix construction to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for better denoising, and (2) signal denoising via frequency domain filtering to suppress noise while preserving fault-related patterns. Building on this foundation, we develop MBFL-DKMR, a fault localization framework that utilizes the refined matrix with fuzzy values for suspiciousness calculation. Our evaluation on Defects4J v2.0.0 demonstrates that MBFL-DKMR effectively mitigates the noise and outperforms the state-of-the-art MBFL techniques. Specifically, MBFL-DKMR achieves 129 faults localized at Top-1 compared to 85 for BLMu and 103 for Delta4Ms, with negligible additional computational overhead (0.11 seconds, 0.001\% of total time). This work highlights the potential of signal processing techniques to enhance the effectiveness of MBFL by refining the kill matrix.

Abstract: Software Requirement Document (RD) typically contain tens of thousands of individual requirements, and ensuring consistency among these requirements is critical for the success of software engineering projects. Automated detection methods can significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs; however, existing approaches still face several challenges, including low detection accuracy on imbalanced data, limited semantic extraction due to the use of a single encoder, and suboptimal performance in cross-domain transfer learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Transferable Software Requirement Conflict Detection Framework based on SBERT and SimCSE, termed TSRCDF-SS. First, the framework employs two independent encoders, Sentence-BERT (SBERT) and Simple Contrastive Sentence Embedding (SimCSE), to generate sentence embeddings for requirement pairs, followed by a six-element concatenation strategy. Furthermore, the classifier is enhanced by a two-layer fully connected feedforward neural network (FFNN) with a hybrid loss optimization strategy that integrates a variant of Focal Loss, domain-specific constraints, and a confidence-based penalty term. Finally, the framework synergistically integrates sequential and cross-domain transfer learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a 10.4% improvement in both macro-F1 and weighted-F1 scores in in-domain settings, and an 11.4% increase in macro-F1 in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Digital twins (DT) have emerged as a transformative technology, enabling real-time monitoring, simulations, and predictive maintenance across various domains, though their Application in the networking domain remains underexplored. This paper focuses on issues such as increasing client density and traffic congestion by proposing a digital twin for computer networks. Our Digital Twin, named Access Point Digital Twin (APDT) is used for tracking user behavior and changing bandwidth demands, directly impacting network performance and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters like latency, jitter, etc. APDT captures the real-time state of networks with data from access points (APs), enabling simulation-based analyses and predictive modelling. APDT facilitates the simulation of various what-if scenarios thereby providing a better understanding of various aspects of the network characteristics. We tested APDT on our University network. APDT uses data collected from three access points via the Ruckus SmartZone API and incorporates NS-3 based simulations. The simulation replicates a real-time snapshot from a Ruckus access point and models metrics such as latency and inter-packet transfer time. Additionally, a forecasting model predicts traffic congestion and suggests proactive client offloading, enhancing network management and performance optimization. Preliminary results indicate that APDT can successfully predict short-term traffic surges, leading to improved QoS and reduced traffic congestion.

Abstract: This article addresses the development of quantum communication methods in the context of emerging quantum computing threats and emphasizes the importance of key reconciliation in quantum communication systems. The study focuses on the CASCADE protocol and the design of a software prototype intended for research and educational purposes. A parallel error-correction algorithm based on the actor model was implemented, improving the efficiency of key reconciliation and reducing the amount of exchanged data. Evaluation of the prototype revealed limitations, including the computational cost of message passing, complexity of error handling, and code redundancy due to iterative development. Experimental results confirmed the correct implementation of the core CASCADE algorithms and informed the design of future improvements. Proposed enhancements include redesigning the system architecture, developing interfaces for exporting intermediate data, defining the communication channel as a separate component, and expanding tools for systematic verification and comparative analysis of blind key-reconciliation methods.

Abstract: As LLMs reshape software development, integrating LLM-augmented practices into SE education has become imperative. While existing studies explore LLMs' educational use in introductory programming or isolated SE tasks, their impact in more open-ended Project-Based Learning (PBL) remains unexplored. This paper introduces a two-year longitudinal study comparing a 2024 (using early free LLMs, $n$=48) and 2025 (using the latest paid LLMs, $n$=46) cohort. Our findings suggest the latest powerful LLMs' dual role: they act as "equalizers," boosting average performance even for programming-weak students, providing opportunities for more authentic SE practices; yet also as "amplifiers," dramatically widening absolute performance gaps, creating new pedagogical challenges for addressing educational inequities.

Abstract: Vibe coding, the much-touted use of AI techniques for programming, faces two overwhelming obstacles: the difficulty of specifying goals ("prompt engineering" is a form of requirements engineering, one of the toughest disciplines of software engineering); and the hallucination phenomenon. Programs are only useful if they are correct or very close to correct.
  The solution? Combine the creativity of artificial intelligence with the rigor of formal specification methods and the power of formal program verification, supported by modern proof tools.

Abstract: Dynamically resolving method reachability in Android applications remains a critical and largely unsolved problem. Despite notable advancements in GUI testing and static call graph construction, current tools are insufficient for reliably driving execution toward specific target methods, especially those not embedded in a graphical component (e.g., libraries' methods), a capability essential for tasks such as vulnerability validation, debugging, and behavioral analysis.
  We present GAPS (Graph-based Automated Path Synthesizer), the first system that integrates static, method-guided call graph analysis with dynamic, interaction-driven execution. GAPS performs a lightweight backward traversal of the call graph, guided by data-flow analysis, to reconstruct paths reaching the target methods. These paths are then translated into instructions that guide runtime app exploration.
  On the AndroTest benchmark, GAPS statically identifies paths to reach 88.24\% of the target methods in just 4.27 seconds per app and dynamically reaches 57.44\% of them. In contrast, state-of-the-art dynamic interaction tools show significantly lower reachability over three runs: APE, one of the best model-based GUI testers, achieves 12.82\%, while GoalExplorer, a hybrid analysis tool, reaches 9.69\%, and Guardian, an LLM-based UI automator, reaches 17.12\%. Static analysis tools also fall short: FlowDroid and DroidReach identify paths to reach 58.81\% and 9.48\% of the targets, requiring 35.06 seconds and 23.46 seconds per app, respectively.
  Finally, an evaluation on the 50 most downloaded real-world apps demonstrates GAPS's practical utility in analyzing security-critical code under a realistic scenario. With an average static analysis time of 278.9 seconds, GAPS statically reconstructs paths to 62.03\% of the target methods and dynamically reaches 59.86\% of them.

Abstract: Mutation-based Fault Localization (MBFL) has been widely explored for automated software debugging, leveraging artificial mutants to identify faulty code entities. However, MBFL faces significant challenges due to interference mutants generated from non-faulty code entities but can be killed by failing tests. These mutants mimic the test sensitivity behaviors of real faulty code entities and weaken the effectiveness of fault localization. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Fault Localization Interference Mutants (FLIMs) and conduct a theoretical analysis based on the Reachability, Infection, Propagation, and Revealability (RIPR) model, identifying four distinct interference causes. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to semantically recognize and mitigate FLIMs using LLM-based semantic analysis, enhanced by fine-tuning techniques and confidence estimation strategies to address LLM output instability. The recognized FLIMs are then mitigated by refining the suspiciousness scores calculated from MBFL techniques. We integrate FLIM recognition and mitigation into the MBFL workflow, developing MBFL-FLIM, a fault localization framework that enhances MBFL's effectiveness by reducing misleading interference while preserving real fault-revealing information. Our empirical experiments on the Defects4J benchmark with 395 program versions using eight LLMs demonstrate MBFL-FLIM's superiority over traditional SBFL and MBFL methods, advanced dynamic feature-based approaches, and recent LLM-based fault localization techniques. Specifically, MBFL-FLIM achieves an average improvement of 44 faults in the Top-1 metric, representing a significant enhancement over baseline methods. Further evaluation confirms MBFL-FLIM's robust performance in multi-fault scenarios, with ablation experiments validating the contributions of the fine-tuning and confidence estimation components.

Abstract: Chart-to-code generation is a critical task in automated data visualization, translating complex chart structures into executable programs. While recent Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) improve chart representation, existing approaches still struggle to achieve cross-type generalization, memory efficiency, and modular design. To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2C-MoLA, a multimodal framework that synergizes Mixture of Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The MoE component uses a complexity-aware routing mechanism with domain-specialized experts and load-balanced sparse gating, dynamically allocating inputs based on learnable structural metrics like element count and chart complexity. LoRA enables parameter-efficient updates for resource-conscious tuning, further supported by a tailored training strategy that aligns routing stability with semantic accuracy. Experiments on Chart2Code-160k show that the proposed model improves generation accuracy by up to 17%, reduces peak GPU memory by 18%, and accelerates convergence by 20%, when compared to standard fine-tuning and LoRA-only baselines, particularly on complex charts. Ablation studies validate optimal designs, such as 8 experts and rank-8 LoRA, and confirm scalability for real-world multimodal code generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in reasoning, generalization, and simulating human-like behavior across a wide range of tasks. These strengths present new opportunities to enhance traditional recommendation systems (RS), especially in the cold-start item scenario where newly introduced items lack interactions. Existing works have used LLMs to address cold-start issues in traditional RS through data augmentation, but they have limitations. One recent work directly addresses this issue by prompting LLMs to generate augmented interaction data between randomly sampled users and cold-start items. Then, they train the traditional RS with augmented data, incorporating collaborative signals for cold-start items. Although they use LLMs to provide cold-start items with feedback, they use partial user histories, which does not allow the LLM to fully emulate the user. Furthermore, randomly selecting users is not optimal for augmentation. To address these challenges, we leverage the LLM as a user and develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains a policy to select users for augmentation, optimizing for cold-start item performance after augmented training. The policy model learns to select users for cold-start item data augmentation based on their behavioral features and histories. To optimize user selection for cold-start item performance, we employ a policy gradient method that updates the policy in the direction of actions that lead to high rewards. Experiments on Amazon Product Review datasets show substantial gains in cold-start item recall, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method as a scalable, serving-efficient augmentation strategy for modern RS.

Abstract: We evaluate the performance of various text embedding models and pipeline configurations for AI-driven search systems. We compare sentence-transformer and generative embedding models (e.g., All-MPNet, BGE, GTE, and Qwen) at different dimensions, indexing methods (Milvus HNSW/IVF), and chunking strategies. A custom evaluation dataset of 11,975 query-chunk pairs was synthesized from US City Council meeting transcripts using a local large language model (LLM). The data pipeline includes preprocessing, automated question generation per chunk, manual validation, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) integration. We measure retrieval accuracy using reference-based metrics: Top-K Accuracy and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). Our results demonstrate that higher-dimensional embeddings significantly boost search quality (e.g., Qwen3-Embedding-8B/4096 achieves Top-3 accuracy about 0.571 versus 0.412 for GTE-large/1024), and that neural re-rankers (e.g., a BGE cross-encoder) further improve ranking accuracy (Top-3 up to 0.527). Finer-grained chunking (512 characters versus 2000 characters) also improves accuracy. We discuss the impact of these factors and outline future directions for pipeline automation and evaluation.

Abstract: Image-Guided Retrieval with Optional Text (IGROT) unifies visual retrieval (without text) and composed retrieval (with text). Despite its relevance in applications like Google Image and Bing, progress has been limited by the lack of an accessible benchmark and methods that balance performance across subtasks. Large-scale datasets such as MagicLens are comprehensive but computationally prohibitive, while existing models often favor either visual or compositional queries. We introduce FIGROTD, a lightweight yet high-quality IGROT dataset with 16,474 training triplets and 1,262 test triplets across CIR, SBIR, and CSTBIR. To reduce redundancy, we propose the Variance Guided Feature Mask (VaGFeM), which selectively enhances discriminative dimensions based on variance statistics. We further adopt a dual-loss design (InfoNCE + Triplet) to improve compositional reasoning. Trained on FIGROTD, VaGFeM achieves competitive results on nine benchmarks, reaching 34.8 mAP@10 on CIRCO and 75.7 mAP@200 on Sketchy, outperforming stronger baselines despite fewer triplets.

Abstract: Image-Guided Retrieval with Optional Text (IGROT) is a general retrieval setting where a query consists of an anchor image, with or without accompanying text, aiming to retrieve semantically relevant target images. This formulation unifies two major tasks: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) and Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR). In this work, we address IGROT under low-data supervision by introducing UNION, a lightweight and generalisable target representation that fuses the image embedding with a null-text prompt. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fixed target features, UNION enhances semantic alignment with multimodal queries while requiring no architectural modifications to pretrained vision-language models. With only 5,000 training samples - from LlavaSCo for CIR and Training-Sketchy for SBIR - our method achieves competitive results across benchmarks, including CIRCO mAP@50 of 38.5 and Sketchy mAP@200 of 82.7, surpassing many heavily supervised baselines. This demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of UNION in bridging vision and language across diverse query types.

Abstract: In web environments, user preferences are often refined progressively as users move from browsing broad categories to exploring specific items. However, existing generative recommenders overlook this natural refinement process. Generative recommendation formulates next-item prediction as autoregressive generation over tokenized user histories, where each item is represented as a sequence of discrete tokens. Prior models typically fuse heterogeneous attributes such as ID, category, title, and description into a single embedding before quantization, which flattens the inherent semantic hierarchy of items and fails to capture the gradual evolution of user intent during web interactions. To address this limitation, we propose CoFiRec, a novel generative recommendation framework that explicitly incorporates the Coarse-to-Fine nature of item semantics into the tokenization process. Instead of compressing all attributes into a single latent space, CoFiRec decomposes item information into multiple semantic levels, ranging from high-level categories to detailed descriptions and collaborative filtering signals. Based on this design, we introduce the CoFiRec Tokenizer, which tokenizes each level independently while preserving structural order. During autoregressive decoding, the language model is instructed to generate item tokens from coarse to fine, progressively modeling user intent from general interests to specific item-level interests. Experiments across multiple public benchmarks and backbones demonstrate that CoFiRec outperforms existing methods, offering a new perspective for generative recommendation. Theoretically, we prove that structured tokenization leads to lower dissimilarity between generated and ground truth items, supporting its effectiveness in generative recommendation. Our code is available at https://github.com/YennNing/CoFiRec.

Abstract: This letter proposes a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework for secure deployment and beamforming in an aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS) assisted millimeter-wave system. To account for multi-timescale uncertainties arising from user mobility, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and hardware impairments, our approach decouples the long-term unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) placement from the per-slot beamforming design. By employing the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a distribution-free risk metric, a low-complexity algorithm is developed, which combines a surrogate model for efficient deployment with an alternating optimization (AO) scheme for robust real-time beamforming. Simulation results validate that the proposed DRO-CVaR framework significantly enhances the tail-end secrecy spectral efficiency and maintains a lower outage probability compared to benchmark schemes, especially under severe uncertainty conditions.

Abstract: Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) leverage federated learning to protect user privacy by retaining data locally. However, user embeddings in FedRecs often encode sensitive attribute information, rendering them vulnerable to attribute inference attacks. Attribute unlearning has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate this issue. In this paper, we focus on user-level FedRecs, which is a more practical yet challenging setting compared to group-level FedRecs. Adversarial training emerges as the most feasible approach within this context. We identify two key challenges in implementing adversarial training-based attribute unlearning for user-level FedRecs: i) mitigating training instability caused by user data heterogeneity, and ii) preventing attribute information leakage through gradients. To address these challenges, we propose FedAU2, an attribute unlearning method for user-level FedRecs. For CH1, we propose an adaptive adversarial training strategy, where the training dynamics are adjusted in response to local optimization behavior. For CH2, we propose a dual-stochastic variational autoencoder to perturb the adversarial model, effectively preventing gradient-based information leakage. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedAU2 achieves superior performance in unlearning effectiveness and recommendation performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Evaluating recommender systems remains a long-standing challenge, as offline methods based on historical user interactions and train-test splits often yield unstable and inconsistent results due to exposure bias, popularity bias, sampled evaluations, and missing-not-at-random patterns. In contrast, textual document retrieval benefits from robust, standardized evaluation via Cranfield-style test collections, which combine pooled relevance judgments with controlled setups. While recent work shows that adapting this methodology to recommender systems is feasible, constructing such collections remains costly due to the need for manual relevance judgments, thus limiting scalability. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as reliable automatic judges to address these scalability challenges. Using the ML-32M-ext Cranfield-style movie recommendation collection, we first examine the limitations of existing evaluation methodologies. Then we explore the alignment and the recommender systems ranking agreement between the LLM-judge and human provided relevance labels. We find that incorporating richer item metadata and longer user histories improves alignment, and that LLM-judge yields high agreement with human-based rankings (Kendall's tau = 0.87). Finally, an industrial case study in the podcast recommendation domain demonstrates the practical value of LLM-judge for model selection. Overall, our results show that LLM-judge is a viable and scalable approach for evaluating recommender systems.

Abstract: Ethics has become a major concern to the information management community, as both algorithms and data should satisfy ethical rules that guarantee not to generate dishonourable behaviours when they are used. However, these ethical rules may vary according to the situation-the context-in which the application programs must work. In this paper, after reviewing the basic ethical concepts and their possible influence on data management, we propose a bipartite conceptual model, composed of the Context Dimensions Tree (CDT), which describes the possible contexts, and the Ethical Requirements Tree (ERT), representing the ethical rules necessary to tailor and preprocess the datasets that should be fed to Data Analysis and Learning Systems in each possible context. We provide some examples and suggestions on how these conceptual tools can be used.

Abstract: Shapley-like values, including the Shapley and Banzhaf values, provide a principled way to quantify how individual tuples contribute to a query result. Their exact computation, however, is intractable because it requires aggregating marginal contributions over exponentially many permutations or subsets. While sampling-based estimators have been studied in cooperative game theory, their direct use for relational query answering remains underexplored and often ignores the structure of schemas and joins.
  We study tuple-level attribution for relational queries through sampling and introduce Relation-Stratified Sampling (RSS). Instead of stratifying coalitions only by size, RSS partitions the sample space by a relation-wise count vector that records how many tuples are drawn from each relation. This join-aware stratification concentrates samples on structurally valid and informative coalitions and avoids strata that cannot satisfy query conditions. We further develop an adaptive variant, ARSS, that reallocates budget across strata using variance estimates obtained during sampling, improving estimator efficiency without increasing the total number of samples. We analyze these estimators, describe a practical implementation that reuses compiled views to reduce per-sample query cost, and evaluate them on TPCH workloads.
  Across diverse queries with multi-relation joins and aggregates, RSS and ARSS consistently outperform classical Monte Carlo (MCS) and size-based Stratified Sampling (SS), yielding lower error and variance with fewer samples. An ablation shows that relation-aware stratification and adaptive allocation contribute complementary gains, making ARSS a simple, effective, and anytime estimator for database-centric Shapley attribution.

Abstract: The deployment of databases across geographically distributed regions has become increasingly critical for ensuring data reliability and scalability. Recent studies indicate that distributed databases exhibit significantly higher latency than single-node databases, primarily due to consensus protocols maintaining data consistency across multiple nodes. We argue that synchronization cost constitutes the primary bottleneck for distributed databases, which is particularly pronounced in wide-area networks (WAN). Fortunately, we identify opportunities to optimize synchronization costs in real production environments: (1) network clustering phenomena, (2) triangle inequality violations in transmission, and (3) redundant data transfers. Based on these observations, we propose GeoCoCo, a synchronization acceleration framework for cross-region distributed databases. First, GeoCoCo presents a group rescheduling strategy that adapts to real-time network conditions to maximize WAN transmission efficiency. Second, GeoCoCo introduces a task-preserving data filtering method that reduces data volume transmitted over the WAN. Finally, GeoCoCo develops a consistency-guaranteed transmission framework integrating grouping and pruning. Extensive evaluations in both trace-driven simulations and real-world deployments demonstrate that GeoCoCo reduces synchronization cost-primarily by lowering WAN bandwidth usage-by up to 40.3%, and increases system throughput by up to 14.1% in GeoGauss.

Abstract: Entity matching is a fundamental task in data cleaning and data integration. With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs), recent studies have explored zero-shot and few-shot prompting to improve entity matching accuracy. However, most existing approaches rely on single-step prompting and offer limited investigation into structured reasoning strategies. In this work, we investigate how to enhance LLM-based entity matching by decomposing the matching process into multiple explicit reasoning stages. We propose a three-step framework that first identifies matched and unmatched tokens between two records, then determines the attributes most influential to the matching decision, and finally predicts whether the records refer to the same real-world entity. In addition, we explore a debate-based strategy that contrasts supporting and opposing arguments to improve decision robustness. We evaluate our approaches against multiple existing baselines on several real-world entity matching benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that structured multi-step reasoning can improve matching performance in several cases, while also highlighting remaining challenges and opportunities for further refinement of reasoning-guided LLM approaches.

Abstract: A long line of concurrency-control (CC) protocols argues correctness via a single serialization point (begin or commit), an assumption that is incompatible with snapshot isolation (SI), where read-write anti-dependencies arise. Serial Safety Net (SSN) offers a lightweight commit-time test but is conservative and effectively anchored on commit time as the sole point. We present ESSN, a principled generalization of SSN that relaxes the exclusion condition to allow more transactions to commit safely, and we prove that this preserves multiversion serializability (MVSR) and that it strictly subsumes SSN. ESSN states an MVSG (Multiversion Serialization Graph)-based criterion and introduces a known total order over transactions (KTO; e.g., begin-ordered or commit-ordered) for reasoning about the graph's serializability. With a single commit-time check under invariant-based semantics, ESSN's exclusion condition preserves monotonicity along per-item version chains, and eliminates chain traversal. The protocol is Direct Serialization Graph (DSG)-based with commit-time work linear in the number of reads and writes, matching SSN's per-version footprint. We also make mixed workloads explicit by defining a Long transaction via strict interval containment of Short transactions, and we evaluate ESSN on reproducible workloads. Under a commit-ordered KTO, using begin-snapshot reads reduces the long-transaction abort rate by up to approximately 0.25 absolute (about 50% relative) compared with SSN.

Abstract: Abstract instructions in piano education, such as "raise your wrist" and "relax your tension," lead to varying interpretations among learners, preventing instructors from effectively conveying their intended pedagogical guidance. To address this problem, this study conducted systematic interviews with a piano professor with 18 years teaching experience, and two researchers derived seven core need groups through cross-validation. Based on these findings, we developed a web-based dashboard prototype integrating video, motion capture, and musical scores, enabling instructors to provide concrete, visual feedback instead of relying solely on abstract verbal instructions. Technical feasibility was validated through 109 performance datasets.

Abstract: Multi-modal generation struggles to ensure thematic coherence and style consistency. Semantically, existing methods suffer from cross-modal mismatch and lack explicit modeling of commonality and discrepancy. Methods that rely on fine-grained training fail to balance semantic precision with writing style consistency. These shortcomings lead to suboptimal generation quality. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{\textit{TIPPo}}, a simple yet effective framework with explicit input modeling and comprehensive optimization objectives. It extracts the input text and images via multi-modal encoder and adapters, then measures the visual prototype. \textbf{T}extual, \textbf{I}mage, and \textbf{P}rototype signals are then fed to our proposed Dual Alignment Attention and Difference Operator modules before language model decoding. The proposed \textbf{Po}lishPPO reinforces the style consistency, while the unsupervised contrastive learning during SFT mitigates inter-sample representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of \textbf{\textit{TIPPo}} in automatic evaluation and LLM-based criteria for creativity and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have recently achieved impressive visual quality, yet most systems still generate silent clips and treat audio as a secondary concern. Existing audio-video generation pipelines typically decompose the task into cascaded stages, which accumulate errors across modalities and are trained under separate objectives. Recent joint audio-video generators alleviate this issue but often rely on dual-tower architectures with ad-hoc cross-modal bridges and static, single-shot text conditioning, making it difficult to both reuse T2V backbones and to reason about how audio, video and language interact over time. To address these challenges, we propose 3MDiT, a unified tri-modal diffusion transformer for text-driven synchronized audio-video generation. Our framework models video, audio and text as jointly evolving streams: an isomorphic audio branch mirrors a T2V backbone, tri-modal omni-blocks perform feature-level fusion across the three modalities, and an optional dynamic text conditioning mechanism updates the text representation as audio and video evidence co-evolve. The design supports two regimes: training from scratch on audio-video data, and orthogonally adapting a pretrained T2V model without modifying its backbone. Experiments show that our approach generates high-quality videos and realistic audio while consistently improving audio-video synchronization and tri-modal alignment across a range of quantitative metrics.

Abstract: The task of Visual Text-to-Speech (VisualTTS), also known as video dubbing, aims to generate speech synchronized with the lip movements in an input video, in additional to being consistent with the content of input text and cloning the timbre of a reference speech. Existing VisualTTS models typically adopt lightweight architectures and design specialized modules to achieve the above goals respectively, yet the speech quality is not satisfied due to the model capacity and the limited data in VisualTTS. Recently, speech large language models (SpeechLLM) show the robust ability to generate high-quality speech. But few work has been done to well leverage temporal cues from video input in generating lip-synchronized speech. To generate both high-quality and lip-synchronized speech in VisualTTS tasks, we propose a novel Visual Speech Language Model called VSpeechLM based upon a SpeechLLM. To capture the synchronization relationship between text and video, we propose a text-video aligner. It first learns fine-grained alignment between phonemes and lip movements, and then outputs an expanded phoneme sequence containing lip-synchronization cues. Next, our proposed SpeechLLM based decoders take the expanded phoneme sequence as input and learns to generate lip-synchronized speech. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VSpeechLM significantly outperforms previous VisualTTS methods in terms of overall quality, speaker similarity, and synchronization metrics.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) aims to enhance emotion understanding by integrating complementary cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. Existing MERC approaches predominantly focus on cross-modal shared features, often overlooking modality-specific features that capture subtle yet critical emotional cues such as micro-expressions, prosodic variations, and sarcasm. Although related work in multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has explored disentangling shared and modality-specific features, these methods typically employ rigid orthogonal constraints to achieve full disentanglement, which neglects the inherent complementarity between feature types and may limit recognition performance. To address these challenges, we propose Angle-Optimized Feature Learning (AO-FL), a framework tailored for MERC that achieves partial disentanglement of shared and specific features within each modality through adaptive angular optimization. Specifically, AO-FL aligns shared features across modalities to ensure semantic consistency, and within each modality it adaptively models the angular relationship between its shared and modality-specific features to preserve both distinctiveness and complementarity. An orthogonal projection refinement further removes redundancy in specific features and enriches shared features with contextual information, yielding more discriminative multimodal representations. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AO-FL for MERC, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, AO-FL can be seamlessly integrated with various unimodal feature extractors and extended to other multimodal fusion tasks, such as MER, thereby highlighting its strong generalization beyond MERC.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversation (MERC) significantly enhances emotion recognition performance by integrating complementary emotional cues from text, audio, and visual modalities. While existing methods commonly utilize techniques such as contrastive learning and cross-attention mechanisms to align cross-modal emotional semantics, they typically overlook modality-specific emotional nuances like micro-expressions, tone variations, and sarcastic language. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orthogonal Disentanglement with Projected Feature Alignment (OD-PFA), a novel framework designed explicitly to capture both shared semantics and modality-specific emotional cues. Our approach first decouples unimodal features into shared and modality-specific components. An orthogonal disentanglement strategy (OD) enforces effective separation between these components, aided by a reconstruction loss to maintain critical emotional information from each modality. Additionally, a projected feature alignment strategy (PFA) maps shared features across modalities into a common latent space and applies a cross-modal consistency alignment loss to enhance semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations on widely-used benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, demonstrate effectiveness of our proposed OD-PFA multimodal emotion recognition tasks, as compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image generative models have improved narrative consistency in story visualization. However, current story visualization models often overlook cultural dimensions, resulting in visuals that lack authenticity and cultural fidelity. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive multicultural analysis of story visualization using current text-to-image models across multilingual settings on two datasets: FlintstonesSV and VIST. To assess cultural dimensions rigorously, we propose a Progressive Multicultural Evaluation Framework and introduce five story visualization metrics, Cultural Appropriateness, Visual Aesthetics, Cohesion, Semantic Consistency, and Object Presence, that are not addressed by existing metrics. We further automate assessment through an MLLM-as-Jury framework that approximates human judgment. Human evaluations show that models generate more coherent, visually appealing, and culturally appropriate stories for real-world datasets than for animated ones. The generated stories exhibit a stronger alignment with English-speaking cultures across all metrics except Cohesion, where Chinese performs better. In contrast, Hindi ranks lowest on all metrics except Visual Aesthetics, reflecting real-world cultural biases embedded in current models. This multicultural analysis provides a foundation for future research aimed at generating culturally appropriate and inclusive visual stories across diverse linguistic and cultural settings.
