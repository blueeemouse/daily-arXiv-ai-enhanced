However, the corresponding models often operate as black boxes, leading them to unintentionally act unfairly towards different demographic groups. This has led to a growing focus on fairness in AI software recently, alongside the traditional focus on the effectiveness of AI models. Through 26 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from different application domains and with varied backgrounds across 23 countries, we conducted research on fairness requirements in AI from software engineering perspective. Our study assesses the participants' awareness of fairness in AI / ML software and its application within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from translating fairness concerns into requirements to assessing their arising early in the SDLC. It also examines fairness through the key assessment dimensions of implementation, validation, evaluation, and how it is balanced with trade-offs involving other priorities, such as addressing all the software functionalities and meeting critical delivery deadlines. Findings of our thematic qualitative analysis show that while our participants recognize the aforementioned AI fairness dimensions, practices are inconsistent, and fairness is often deprioritized with noticeable knowledge gaps. This highlights the need for agreement with relevant stakeholders on well-defined, contextually appropriate fairness definitions, the corresponding evaluation metrics, and formalized processes to better integrate fairness into AI/ML projects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc726\u6b21\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6765\u81ea23\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u4e0d\u540c\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u5bf9AI/ML\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8df5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5e38\u5e38\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u5c31\u660e\u786e\u3001\u9002\u5408\u60c5\u5883\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fbe\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6b63\u5f0f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5230AI/ML\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u95ee\u9898\u65e5\u76ca\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6ce8\u91cdAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u89c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76AI\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u65bd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf923\u4e2a\u56fd\u5bb6\u5185\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u53ca\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u8fdb\u884c26\u6b21\u534a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bbf\u8c08\u6765\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf9\u4e8eAI/ML\u8f6f\u4ef6\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6982\u5ff5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f97\u5230\u4f53\u73b0\u6216\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u6362\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b49\u73af\u8282\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5148\u4e8b\u9879\u5982\u529f\u80fd\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4ed8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u666e\u904d\u610f\u8bc6\u5230AI\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5374\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ecf\u5e38\u88ab\u6392\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u534f\u5546\u786e\u5b9a\u6e05\u6670\u800c\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u539f\u5219\u878d\u5165AI/ML\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728AI/ML\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4eba\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u5f0f\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u52a0\u5177\u4f53\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6210\u4e3aAI\u9879\u76ee\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u3002"}}

However, the effectiveness of tool use depends heavily on the quality of the associated documentation and knowledge base context. These materials are usually written for human users and are often misaligned with how LLMs interpret information. This problem is even more pronounced in industrial settings, where hundreds of tools with overlapping functionality create challenges in scalability, variability, and ambiguity. We propose Verification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO), a framework that uses LLMs as editors to automatically refine tool-related documentation and knowledge base context. VGCO works in two stages. First, Evaluation collects real-world failure cases and identifies mismatches between tools and their context. Second, Optimization performs hierarchical editing through offline learning with structure-aware, in-context optimization. The novelty of our LLM editors has three main aspects. First, they use a hierarchical structure that naturally integrates into the tool-calling workflow. Second, they are state-aware, action-specific, and verification-guided, which constrains the search space and enables efficient, targeted improvements. Third, they enable cost-efficient sub-task specialization, either by prompt engineering large editor models or by post-training smaller editor models. Unlike prior work that emphasizes multi-turn reasoning, VGCO focuses on the single-turn, large-scale tool-calling problem and achieves significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVGCO\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0cVGCO\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6587\u6863\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u7528\u6237\u7f16\u5199\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e0a\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u6570\u91cf\u4f17\u591a\u4e14\u529f\u80fd\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aVerification-Guided Context Optimization (VGCO)\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6\u5b9e\u9645\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6267\u884c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "VGCO\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u8c03\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u652f\u6301\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5730\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u53ca\u80cc\u666f\u8d44\u6599\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6750\u6599\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context.\n  We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.", "AI": {"tldr": "ContextBranch, a conversation management system, improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn and exploratory programming tasks by applying version control semantics to LLM interactions.

Additionally, branching reduced the size of the context by 58.1%, from an average of 31.0 to 13.0 messages, effectively eliminating unnecessary exploratory content.", "conclusion": "The conclusion of the paper establishes conversation branching as a critical tool for AI-assisted exploratory work. By allowing for the isolation of different lines of exploration, ContextBranch prevents the pollution of context, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting complex, multi-turn conversations. This approach is shown to be particularly beneficial in handling the intricacies of exploratory programming tasks."}}

Published in Applied Sciences, 2025", "summary": "The real-time deployment of cascaded generative AI pipelines for applications like video translation is constrained by significant system-level challenges. These include the cumulative latency of sequential model inference and the quadratic ($\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) computational complexity that renders multi-user video conferencing applications unscalable. This paper proposes and evaluates a practical system-level framework designed to mitigate these critical bottlenecks. The proposed architecture incorporates a turn-taking mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user scenarios, and a segmented processing protocol to manage inference latency for a perceptually real-time experience. We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($\u03c4< 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience. The work presents a validated, end-to-end system design that offers a practical roadmap for deploying scalable, real-time generative AI applications in multilingual communication platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u9891\u4f1a\u8bae\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8f6e\u6d41\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u7ba1\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u6d41\u7545\u4e0d\u95f4\u65ad\u7684\u64ad\u653e\u4f53\u9a8c\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u53d7\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u6311\u6218\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7d2f\u79ef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u7528\u6237\u89c6\u9891\u4f1a\u8bae\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\uff08$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f6e\u6d41\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u5c06\u591a\u7528\u6237\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4ece\u4e8c\u6b21\u51cf\u5c11\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6bb5\u5904\u7406\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u4f9b\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff08$\u03c4< 1.0$\uff09\u3002\u4e3b\u89c2\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7528\u6237\u613f\u610f\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u9884\u89c1\u7684\u3001\u6700\u521d\u7684\u5904\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u987a\u7545\u65e0\u4e2d\u65ad\u7684\u64ad\u653e\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u901a\u4fe1\u5e73\u53f0\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u9053\u8def\u56fe\u3002"}}

Traditional event data models, also called case-centric, are unable to cope with the complexity introduced by these more refined relationships. Several models have been made to move from case-centric to Object-Centric Event Data (OCED), trying to retain simplicity as much as possible. Still, these suffer from inherent ambiguities, and lack a comprehensive support of essential dimensions related to time and (dynamic) relations. In this work, we propose to fill this gap by leveraging a well-founded ontology of events and bringing ontological foundations to OCED, with a three-step approach. First, we start from key open issues reported in the literature regarding current OCED metamodels, and witness their ambiguity and expressiveness limitations on illustrative and representative examples proposed therein. Second, we consider the OCED Core Model, currently proposed as the basis for defining a new standard for object-centric event data, and we enhance it by grounding it on a lightweight version of UFO-B called gUFO, a well-known foundational ontology tailored to the representation of objects, events, time, and their (dynamic) relations. This results in a new metamodel, which we call gOCED. The third contribution then shows how gOCED at once covers the features of existing metamodels preserving their simplicity, and extends them with the essential features needed to overcome the ambiguity and expressiveness issues reported in the literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684UFO-B\u7248\u672cgUFO\u589e\u5f3aOCED\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u540d\u4e3agOCED\u7684\u65b0\u5143\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u662f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u5bf9\u8c61\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4e5f\u79f0\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u4ece\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e(OCED)\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u5185\u5728\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\uff08\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5168\u9762\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u5f53\u524dOCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u8bf4\u660e\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49\u65b0\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u7840\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OCED\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7248\u672c\u7684UFO-B\uff08\u79f0\u4e3agUFO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u6a21\u578bgOCED\u3002", "result": "gOCED\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5176\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u660e\u786e\u548c\u5bcc\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u5143\u6a21\u578bgOCED\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPerfCoder\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6311\u9009\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPerfCoder\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u610f\u8bc6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u5173\u4e8e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u7684LLMs\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6307\u5bfc\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u800c\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PerfCoder\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u4ece\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u5217\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u3001\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002PerfCoder\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u9009\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8def\u5f84\u5e26\u6709\u6613\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5ea6\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u8bae\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u63aa\u65bd\u800c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b8c\u5584\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728PIE\u4ee3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPerfCoder\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u6bd4\u7387\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5355\u9760\u6269\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u5177\u5907\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u610f\u8bc6\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u628aPerfCoder\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u8005\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8005\u534f\u4f5c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e32B\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u53caGPT-5\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u88ab\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u65b0\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u91cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u3002PerfCoder\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002"}}

Traditional codecs are well tuned for this trade-off, yet their inability to use context means they must encode the entire video data and transmit it to the client. This paper introduces ELVIS (End-to-end Learning-based VIdeo Streaming Enhancement Pipeline), an end-to-end architecture that combines server-side encoding optimizations with client-side generative in-painting to remove and reconstruct redundant video data. Its modular design allows ELVIS to integrate different codecs, inpainting models, and quality metrics, making it adaptable to future innovations. Our results show that current technologies achieve improvements of up to 11 VMAF points over baseline benchmarks, though challenges remain for real-time applications due to computational demands.

This decentralization is achieved through the implementation of microservice architectures, which require low latencies to meet stringent service level agreements (SLA) such as performance, reliability, and availability metrics. While cloud computing offers the large data storage and computation resources necessary to handle peak demands, a hybrid cloud and edge environment is required to ensure SLA compliance. This is achieved by sophisticated orchestration strategies such as Kubernetes, which help facilitate resource management. The orchestration strategies alone do not guarantee SLA adherence due to the inherent delay of scaling resources. Existing auto-scaling algorithms have been proposed to address these challenges, but they suffer from performance issues and configuration complexity. In this paper, a novel auto-scaling algorithm is proposed for SLA-constrained edge computing applications. This approach combines a Machine Learning (ML) based proactive auto-scaling algorithm, capable of predicting incoming resource requests to forecast demand, with a reactive autoscaler which considers current resource utilization and SLA constraints for immediate adjustments. The algorithm is integrated into Kubernetes as an extension, and its performance is evaluated through extensive experiments in an edge environment with real applications. The results demonstrate that existing solutions have an SLA violation rate of up to 23%, whereas the proposed hybrid solution outperforms the baselines with an SLA violation rate of only 6%, ensuring stable SLA compliance across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6ee1\u8db3SLA\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u8003\u8651\u5f53\u524d\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u53caSLA\u9650\u5236\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b26\u5408SLA\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06SLA\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u4ece\u6700\u9ad823%\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u4e866%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u519c\u4e1a\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u65b0\u673a\u9047\uff0c\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6307\u6807\u7b49\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u534f\u8bae\uff08SLA\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4e91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5cf0\u9700\u6c42\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u4e91\u6216\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u8bc1SLA\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b58\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684SLA\u9075\u5b88\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u5373\u5c06\u5230\u6765\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8bf7\u6c42\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u8d44\u6e90\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u548cSLA\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u7f29\u653e\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eSLA\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u6700\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b23%\u964d\u81f36%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u8de8\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0bSLA\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u5c55\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u9886\u57df\u9762\u4e34\u7684SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u914d\u7f6e\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent reasoningenhanced methods have shown promise by introducing deliberate, chain-of-thought-like processes with intermediate reasoning steps. However, these methods rely solely on the next target item as supervision, leading to two critical issues: (1) reasoning instability--the process becomes overly sensitive to recent behaviors and spurious interactions like accidental clicks, and (2) surface-level reasoning--the model memorizes item-to-item transitions rather than understanding intrinsic behavior patterns. To address these challenges, we propose IGR-SR, an Intent-Guided Reasoning framework for Sequential Recommendation that anchors the reasoning process to explicitly extracted high-level intents. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a Latent Intent Distiller (LID) that efficiently extracts multi-faceted intents using a frozen encoder with learnable tokens, (2) an Intent-aware Deliberative Reasoner (IDR) that decouples reasoning into intent deliberation and decision-making via a dual-attention architecture, and (3) an Intent Consistency Regularization (ICR) that ensures robustness by enforcing consistent representations across different intent views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that IGR-SR achieves an average 7.13% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Critically, under 20% behavioral noise, IGR-SR degrades only 10.4% compared to 16.2% and 18.6% for competing methods, validating the effectiveness and robustness of intent-guided reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6IGR-SR\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u610f\u56fe\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08\u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u70bc\u5668LID\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406\u5668IDR\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316ICR\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.13%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5bf9\u8fd1\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9879\u76ee\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u800c\u975e\u7406\u89e3\u5185\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u610f\u56fe\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684IGR-SR\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u6f5c\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u63d0\u70bc\u5668(LID)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee4\u724c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u610f\u56fe\uff1b(2) \u610f\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5ba1\u614e\u63a8\u7406\u5668(IDR)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u91cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe\u5ba1\u8bae\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff1b(3) \u610f\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316(ICR)\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u56fe\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cIGR-SR\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57477.13%\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u5c24\u5176\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u572820%\u884c\u4e3a\u566a\u97f3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cIGR-SR\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0b\u964d\u4e86\u4ec510.4%\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5206\u522b\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8616.2%\u548c18.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "IGR-SR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8868\u9762\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising opportunities for automation, existing applications rely on simplistic prompting without task decomposition or domain adaptation, resulting in unreliable black-box behavior and limited insight into model capabilities across penetration testing stages. To address this gap, we introduce PentestEval, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs across six decomposed penetration testing stages: Information Collection, Weakness Gathering and Filtering, Attack Decision-Making, Exploit Generation and Revision. PentestEval integrates expert-annotated ground truth with a fully automated evaluation pipeline across 346 tasks covering all stages in 12 realistic vulnerable scenarios. Our stage-level evaluation of 9 widely used LLMs reveals generally weak performance and distinct limitations across the stages of penetration-testing workflow. End-to-end pipelines reach only 31% success rate, and existing LLM-powered systems such as PentestGPT, PentestAgent, and VulnBot exhibit similar limitations, with autonomous agents failing almost entirely. These findings highlight that autonomous penetration testing demands stronger structured reasoning, where modularization enhances each individual stage and improves overall performance. PentestEval provides the foundational benchmark needed for future research on fine-grained, stage-level evaluation, paving the way toward more reliable LLM-based automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PentestEval\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7346\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c12\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u8868\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u72ec\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u6216\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5bf9\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u529b\u4e86\u89e3\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aPentestEval\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u8ba2\u7b49\u516d\u4e2a\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u4e5d\u79cd\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LLMs\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u666e\u904d\u8f83\u5dee\uff1b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a31%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709LLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982PentestGPT\u3001PentestAgent\u548cVulnBot\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u6e17\u900f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u603b\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u3002PentestEval\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u3001\u9636\u6bb5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u7814\u7a76\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.\n  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism.

However, current methods are constrained by static reasoning trajectories that are ill-suited for the diverse complexity of user behaviors. They suffer from two key limitations: (1) a static reasoning direction, which uses flat supervision signals misaligned with human-like hierarchical reasoning, and (2) a fixed reasoning depth, which inefficiently applies the same computational effort to all users, regardless of pattern complexity. These rigidity lead to suboptimal performance and significant computational waste. To overcome these challenges, we propose DTRec, a novel and effective framework that explores the Dynamic reasoning Trajectory for Sequential Recommendation along both direction and depth. To guide the direction, we develop Hierarchical Process Supervision (HPS), which provides coarse-to-fine supervisory signals to emulate the natural, progressive refinement of human cognitive processes. To optimize the depth, we introduce the Adaptive Reasoning Halting (ARH) mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of reasoning steps by jointly monitoring three indicators. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving up to a 24.5% performance improvement over strong baselines while simultaneously reducing computational cost by up to 41.6%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6DTRec\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5c42\u6b21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\uff08HPS\uff09\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u505c\u6b62\uff08ARH\uff09\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u867d\u7136\u89e3\u9501\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u66f4\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u9759\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DTRec\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u6cbf\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\uff08HPS\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u505c\u6b62(ARH)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe24.5%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u591a\u8fbe41.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65b9\u5411\u4e0a\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u505c\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0cDTRec\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization.

While compact models are the ultimate deployment target, conventional pruning-aware distributed training systems typically fail to reduce communication overhead because unstructured sparsity cannot be efficiently exploited by highly optimized dense collective primitives. We present PruneX, a distributed data-parallel training system that co-designs pruning algorithms with cluster hierarchy to reduce inter-node bandwidth usage. PruneX introduces the Hierarchical Structured ADMM (H-SADMM) algorithm, which enforces node-level structured sparsity before inter-node synchronization, enabling dynamic buffer compaction that eliminates both zero-valued transmissions and indexing overhead. The system adopts a leader-follower execution model with separated intra-node and inter-node process groups, performing dense collectives on compacted tensors over bandwidth-limited links while confining full synchronization to high-bandwidth intra-node interconnects. Evaluation on ResNet architectures across 64 GPUs demonstrates that PruneX reduces inter-node communication volume by approximately 60% and achieves 6.75x strong scaling speedup, outperforming the dense baseline (5.81x) and Top-K gradient compression (3.71x) on the Puhti supercomputer at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finland).", "AI": {"tldr": "PruneX, a new system for distributed training, reduces inter-node communication in multi-GPU setups by 60% and achieves better scaling speedup compared to existing methods through its innovative H-SADMM algorithm and optimized synchronization model.", "motivation": "The motivation behind PruneX is to address the increasing constraint of inter-node communication bandwidth on large-scale distributed training across multiple GPUs.

Existing models predominantly follow a discriminative paradigm, which relies heavily on explicit interactions between raw ID embeddings. However, this paradigm inherently renders them susceptible to two critical issues: embedding dimensional collapse and information redundancy, stemming from the over-reliance on feature interactions \\emph{over raw ID embeddings}. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \\emph{Supervised Feature Generation (SFG)} framework, \\emph{shifting the paradigm from discriminative ``feature interaction\" to generative ``feature generation\"}. Specifically, SFG comprises two key components: an \\emph{Encoder} that constructs hidden embeddings for each feature, and a \\emph{Decoder} tasked with regenerating the feature embeddings of all features from these hidden representations. Unlike existing generative approaches that adopt self-supervised losses, we introduce a supervised loss to utilize the supervised signal, \\ie, click or not, in the CTR prediction task. This framework exhibits strong generalizability: it can be seamlessly integrated with most existing CTR models, reformulating them under the generative paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFG consistently mitigates embedding collapse and reduces information redundancy, while yielding substantial performance gains across various datasets and base models.

Property-based testing addresses this shortcoming by generating multiple inputs satisfying properties but requires significant manual effort to define properties and their constraints. We propose a semantics-based approach that automatically transforms unit tests into property-based tests by extracting specifications from implementations via single-path symbolic analysis. We demonstrate this approach through Teralizer, a prototype for Java that transforms JUnit tests into property-based jqwik tests. Unlike prior work that generalizes from input-output examples, Teralizer derives specifications from program semantics.\n  We evaluated Teralizer on three progressively challenging datasets. On EvoSuite-generated tests for EqBench and Apache Commons utilities, Teralizer improved mutation scores by 1-4 percentage points. Generalization of mature developer-written tests from Apache Commons utilities showed only 0.05-0.07 percentage points improvement. Analysis of 632 real-world Java projects from RepoReapers highlights applicability barriers: only 1.7% of projects completed the generalization pipeline, with failures primarily due to type support limitations in symbolic analysis and static analysis limitations in our prototype. Based on the results, we provide a roadmap for future work, identifying research and engineering challenges that need to be tackled to advance the field of test generalization.\n  Artifacts available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17950381", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177Teralizer\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTeralizer\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u548c\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u9650\u5236\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5355\u4e00\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u8f93\u5165\u672a\u88ab\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5230\u3002\u800c\u5c5e\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c5e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u7ea6\u675f\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u52aa\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5355\u8def\u5f84\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5c06\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aTeralizer\u7684\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u5c06Java\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u5199\u7684JUnit\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8f6c\u6362\u6210jqwik\u5c5e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u96be\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7531EvoSuite\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9488\u5bf9EqBench\u53caApache Commons\u5b9e\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0cTeralizer\u80fd\u5c06\u7a81\u53d8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad81\u81f34\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6240\u7f16\u5199\u4e14\u5df2\u76f8\u5f53\u5b8c\u5584\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5219\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e860.05\u81f30.07\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6765\u81eaRepoReapers\u7684632\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cJava\u9879\u76ee\u540e\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f53\u524d\u539f\u578b\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5927\u7ea61.7%\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u6cdb\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\u6539\u5584\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u9700\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u589e\u5f3a\u7b26\u53f7\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u652f\u6301\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u6539\u8fdb\u9759\u6001\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7b49\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6cdb\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

Any-to-Any models accept combinations of text and multimodal data (e.g., image, video, audio) as input and also generate combinations of text and multimodal data as output, introducing request type, computation path, and computation scaling heterogeneity in model serving.\n  Cornserve allows model developers to describe the computation graph of generic Any-to-Any models, which consists of heterogeneous components such as multimodal encoders, autoregressive models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and multimodal generators like Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). Given this, Cornserve's planner automatically finds an optimized deployment plan for the model, including whether and how to disaggregate the model into smaller components based on model and workload characteristics. Cornserve's distributed runtime then executes the model per the plan, efficiently handling Any-to-Any model heterogeneity during online serving. Evaluations show that Cornserve can efficiently serve diverse Any-to-Any models and workloads, delivering up to 3.81$\\times$ throughput improvement and up to 5.79$\\times$ tail latency reduction over existing solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCornserve\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u63cf\u8ff0\u901a\u7528Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u627e\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\uff0cCornserve\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCornserve\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f33.81\u500d\uff0c\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u81f35.79\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u79f0\u4e3aAny-to-Any\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u53d7\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u8fd9\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8bf7\u6c42\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8def\u5f84\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86Cornserve\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u7528Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bLLMs\uff09\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002Cornserve\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u6839\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7279\u6027\u81ea\u52a8\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u90e8\u7f72\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u662f\u5426\u53ca\u5982\u4f55\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5219\u6309\u7167\u8ba1\u5212\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0cCornserve\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe\u52303.81\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6539\u8fdb\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u8fbe5.79\u500d\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "Cornserve\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u670d\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001Any-to-Any\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u6781\u5927\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, real-world user behaviors are often noisy due to factors such as human errors, uncertainty, and behavioral ambiguity, which can lead to degraded recommendation performance. To address this issue, recent approaches widely adopt self-supervised learning (SSL), particularly contrastive learning, by generating perturbed views of user interaction sequences and maximizing their mutual information to improve model robustness. However, these methods heavily rely on their pre-defined static augmentation strategies~(where the augmentation type remains fixed once chosen) to construct augmented views, leading to two critical challenges: (1) the optimal augmentation type can vary significantly across different scenarios; (2) inappropriate augmentations may even degrade recommendation performance, limiting the effectiveness of SSL. To overcome these limitations, we propose an adaptive augmentation framework. We first unify existing basic augmentation operations into a unified formulation via structured transformation matrices. Building on this, we introduce AsarRec (Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Sequential Recommendation), which learns to generate transformation matrices by encoding user sequences into probabilistic transition matrices and projecting them into hard semi-doubly stochastic matrices via a differentiable Semi-Sinkhorn algorithm. To ensure that the learned augmentations benefit downstream performance, we jointly optimize three objectives: diversity, semantic invariance, and informativeness. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets under varying noise levels validate the effectiveness of AsarRec, demonstrating its superior robustness and consistent improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6AsarRec\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u8f6c\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u76ca\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u597d\u548c\u6355\u6349\u9879\u76ee\u8fc7\u6e21\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u4e3a\u4eba\u4e3a\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u800c\u663e\u5f97\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9759\u6001\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86SSL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aAsarRec\uff08Adaptive Sequential Augmentation for Robust Sequential Recommendation\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u7edf\u4e00\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1b\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u8f6c\u79fb\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206Semi-Sinkhorn\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u5176\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u786c\u534a\u53cc\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u4e2d\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6240\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u53ca\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eAsarRec\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AsarRec\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e8f\u5217\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data. The resulting maps offer important insights for disaster risk reduction, land-use planning, and early warning system development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u96f7\u8fbe\uff08SAR\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u548c\u6c34\u6587\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bf9\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u897f\u90e8Nyando\u6cb3\u6d41\u57df\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u611f\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u56db\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08RF\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u7ed8\u5236\u4e86\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5730\u56fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d2a\u6c34\u662f\u5168\u7403\u6700\u5177\u7834\u574f\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u707e\u5bb3\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u7c7b\u751f\u8ba1\u6784\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u5a01\u80c1\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408SAR\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u53d1\u5730\u533a\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u75282024\u5e745\u6708\u6d2a\u6c34\u4e8b\u4ef6\u671f\u95f4\u83b7\u53d6\u7684Sentinel-1\u53cc\u6781\u5316SAR\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6d2a\u6c34\u5e93\u5b58\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u5761\u5ea6\u3001\u6d77\u62d4\u3001\u671d\u5411\u3001\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528/\u8986\u76d6\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u571f\u58e4\u7c7b\u578b\u53ca\u8ddd\u6eaa\u6d41\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u4e0eSAR\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u5e93\u5b58\u4e00\u8d77\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u56db\u79cd\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1a\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\uff08LR\uff09\u3001\u5206\u7c7b\u56de\u5f52\u6811\uff08CART\uff09\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff08SVM\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08RF\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff08RF\uff09\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u7387=0.762\uff1bKappa\u7cfb\u6570=0.480\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eRF\u7684\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5730\u56fe\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u9760\u8fd1\u7ef4\u591a\u5229\u4e9a\u6e56\u7684\u4f4e\u6d3cKano\u5e73\u539f\u5730\u533a\u5177\u6709\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5386\u53f2\u6d2a\u6c34\u8bb0\u5f55\u53ca2024\u5e745\u6708\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u76f8\u7b26\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06SAR\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6d2a\u6c34\u6613\u611f\u6027\u5236\u56fe\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u3002\u6240\u5f97\u5730\u56fe\u4e3a\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u5bb3\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u571f\u5730\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility.

Under Review", "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications.

While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks. These results demonstrate a practical, principled path to efficient class unlearning in document classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHessian Reassignment\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u5220\u9664\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u88ab\u79fb\u9664\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f88\u5927\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hessian Reassignment\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u6b65\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u662f\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u6b21\u5f71\u54cd\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3Hessian-\u5411\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u51cf\u53bb\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u6240\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u70b9\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b65\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u91cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5220\u9664\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7Top-1\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u65bd\u51b3\u7b56\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6587\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHessian Reassignment\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u7c7b\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u6301\u7eed\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c60\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5f71\u5b50\u653b\u51fb\u6d4b\u91cf\u5230\u7684\u88ab\u79fb\u9664\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHessian Reassignment\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u6863\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

As these systems scale, sustainability concerns have intensified, with most assessments focusing on model architecture, hardware efficiency, and deployment infrastructure. However, existing mitigation efforts largely overlook how user interaction practices themselves shape the energy profile of LLM based systems. In this vision paper, we argue that interaction level behavior appears to be an underexamined factor shaping the environmental impact of LLM based systems, and we present this issue across four dimensions. First, extended conversational patterns increase token production and raise the computational cost of inference. Second, expectations of instant responses limit opportunities for energy aware scheduling and workload consolidation. Third, everyday user habits contribute to cumulative operational demand in ways that are rarely quantified. Fourth, the accumulation of context affects memory requirements and reduces the efficiency of long running dialogues. Addressing these challenges requires rethinking how chatbot interactions are designed and conceptualized, and adopting perspectives that recognize sustainability as partly dependent on the conversational norms through which users engage with LLM based systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6280\u672f\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u6548\u7387\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u5176\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u4e5f\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u52aa\u529b\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u4f46\u8f83\u5c11\u6709\u4eba\u5173\u6ce8\u5230\u7528\u6237\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u672c\u8eab\u4e5f\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u8ba8\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u2014\u2014\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8bdd\u957f\u5ea6\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u5347\u3001\u5373\u65f6\u54cd\u5e94\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8282\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3001\u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e60\u60ef\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8fd0\u8425\u8d1f\u62c5\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u79ef\u7d2f\u5bf9\u5185\u5b58\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u2014\u2014\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u5730\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u671f\u5f85\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b9e\u65bd\u8282\u80fd\u63aa\u65bd\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\uff1b\u957f\u671f\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u4e60\u60ef\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u603b\u80fd\u91cf\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u884c\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u52a0\u73af\u4fdd\u7684\u804a\u5929\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u7528\u6237\u4e0eLLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6d89\u53ca\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u5f62\u6210\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u8282\u7ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

Standard RAG systems typically rely on a fixed top k retrieval strategy, which can either miss relevant information or introduce semantically irrelevant passages, known as distractors, that degrade output quality. Additionally, the positioning of retrieved passages within the input context can influence the model attention and generation outcomes. Context placed in the middle tends to be overlooked, which is an issue known as the \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon. In this work, we systematically analyze the impact of distractors on generation quality, and quantify their effects under varying conditions. We also investigate how the position of relevant passages within the context window affects their influence on generation. Building on these insights, we propose a context-size classifier that dynamically predicts the optimal number of documents to retrieve based on query-specific informational needs. We integrate this approach into a full RAG pipeline, and demonstrate improved performance over fixed k baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f73\u68c0\u7d22\u6587\u6863\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u524dk\u4e2a\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\uff08\u5373\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u6bb5\u843d\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u4e2d\u95f4\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u201d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u5bf9\u5176\u751f\u6210\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u5177\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6587\u6863\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u5b8c\u6574\u7684RAG\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5927\u5c0f\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u56fa\u5b9ak\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u5173\u6bb5\u843d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e03\u5c40\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \\textit{Low risk}, \\textit{Alert}, and \\textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5e9f\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e0eRSV\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u5e9f\u6c34\u4e2d\u7684RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u81ed\u6c27\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u6e7f\u5ea6\u7b49\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u6d32\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u548c\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u5dde\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u4e5f\u6301\u7eed\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fbf\u4e8e\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u7684R Shiny\u4eea\u8868\u677f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5dde\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210RSV\u7206\u53d1\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u547c\u5438\u9053\u5408\u80de\u75c5\u6bd2\uff08RSV\uff09\u662f\u5e7c\u513f\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u66b4\u53d1\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5efa\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0eRSV\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4f\u9662\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ca\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528CART\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u6bcf\u5468\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u3001\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u6bcf\u65e5\u6c14\u8c61\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\u53ca\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6d53\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5e9f\u6c34\u4e2d\u7684RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u88ab\u786e\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6e29\u5ea6\u3001\u81ed\u6c27\u6c34\u5e73\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u6e7f\u5ea6\u7b49\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u91cf\u4e5f\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7f8e\u6d32\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u4e0e\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u5730\u533a\u7684\u5dde\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u76d1\u63a7\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4bRSV\u66b4\u53d1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e2e\u52a9\u66f4\u53ca\u65f6\u5730\u91c7\u53d6\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e92\u52a8\u5f0fR Shiny\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u65b9\u4fbf\u7528\u6237\u63a2\u7d22\u5404\u5dde\u7684RSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u67e5\u770b\u5173\u952e\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

To address these issues, PushGen combines two key components: (1) a controllable category prompt technique to guide LLM outputs toward desired styles, and (2) a reward model that ranks and selects generated candidates.

In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge.

First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.

For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7d27\u5f20\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u76d7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5230\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u5e73\u8861\u7269\u54c1\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5236\u5b9a\u51fa\u66f4\u5177\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u963f\u91cc\u5df4\u5df4\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u7535\u5b50\u5546\u52a1\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u7248\u9762\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63a8\u8350\u5546\u54c1\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u8350\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u9884\u7b97\u610f\u8bc6\u6548\u7528\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b(MDPs)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u516c\u5f0f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u7d27\u5f20\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u8fd8\u662f\u79bb\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u76d7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u578b\u63a8\u8350\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MDP\u4e0e\u9884\u7b97\u610f\u8bc6\u6548\u7528\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Yet, its identification and quantification remain difficult due to subjectivity, context dependence, and the scarcity of high-quality gold-label datasets. We aim to reduce annotation effort by leveraging pairwise comparison for bias annotation. To overcome the costliness of the approach, we evaluate more efficient implementations of pairwise comparison-based rating. We achieve this by investigating the effects of various rating techniques and the parameters of three cost-aware alternatives in a simulation environment. Since the approach can in principle be applied to both human and large language model annotation, our work provides a basis for creating high-quality benchmark datasets and for quantifying biases and other subjective linguistic aspects.\n  The controlled simulations include latent severity distributions, distance-calibrated noise, and synthetic annotator bias to probe robustness and cost-quality trade-offs. In applying the approach to human-labeled bias benchmark datasets, we then evaluate the most promising setups and compare them to direct assessment by large language models and unmodified pairwise comparison labels as baselines. Our findings support the use of pairwise comparison as a practical foundation for quantifying subjective linguistic aspects, enabling reproducible bias analysis. We contribute an optimization of comparison and matchmaking components, an end-to-end evaluation including simulation and real-data application, and an implementation blueprint for cost-aware large-scale annotation", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u6280\u672f\u548c\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u5339\u914d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3001\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6ce8\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u73b0\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u65b0\u95fb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8861\u91cf\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9ec4\u91d1\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u89c1\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u89c1\u6807\u6ce8\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u5206\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u654f\u611f\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u53ca\u672a\u7ecf\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u6807\u7b7e\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u504f\u89c1\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u91cd\u590d\u6267\u884c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u5339\u914d\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u5305\u542b\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6807\u6ce8\u5b9e\u73b0\u84dd\u56fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u9762\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u3002"}}

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG.

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u6f14\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff08PIS\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4efb\u610f\u89c2\u6d4b\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u6f14\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6781\u5176\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e03\u7f6e\u7684\u6709\u9650\u95f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6d41\u4f53\u529b\u5b66\u3001\u5730\u9707\u53cd\u6f14\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "PIS\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u5408\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u8bfe\u7a0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u89c2\u6d4b\u71b5\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e86\u89e3\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "PIS\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a\u8fbe\u897f\u6d41\u3001\u6ce2\u573a\u53cd\u6f14\uff08\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff08\u80e1\u514b\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u89c2\u5bdf\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a0.29%\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cPIS\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53cd\u6f14\u8bef\u5dee\u5e76\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u751f\u6210\u6821\u51c6\u540e\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "PIS\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u4e14\u4e25\u91cd\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u5185\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates. Our fine-tuning-free approach also performs competitively with the fine-tuning variant of LLM-Pruner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLearning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u62e9\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\uff0cLLRC\u5728\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u540e\u538b\u7f29\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6392\u540d\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u53ef\u80fd\u7531\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6709\u9650\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u79e9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aLearning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u9009\u5b9a\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u7801\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9009\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "LLRC\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u540e\u538b\u7f29\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6392\u540d\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728Llama-2-13B\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b020%\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u65f6\uff0cLLRC\u5728MMLU\u3001BoolQ\u548cOpenbookQA\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5206\u522b\u6bd4STRS\u9ad8\u51fa12%\u30013.5%\u548c4.4%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLRC\u8fd8\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8eSVD-LLM\u548cLLM-Pruner\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0eLLM-Pruner\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7248\u672c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLRC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u592a\u591a\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c0f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u7387\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Federated Recommendation (FR) enables such multi-end collaborative training while preserving privacy by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, the large number of parameters, primarily due to the massive item embeddings, significantly hampers communication efficiency. While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead. To address this gap, we propose a FR training framework with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) based embedding designed to reduce the volume of embedding parameters that need to be transmitted. Our approach offers a lightweight, plugin-style solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FR methods. In addition to incorporating common PEFT techniques such as LoRA and Hash-based encoding, we explore the use of Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RQ-VAE) as a novel PEFT strategy within our framework. Extensive experiments across various FR model backbones and datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces communication overhead while improving accuracy.

While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components.

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7(MDD)\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931(TF-MCL)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5934(FMH)\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u53d6\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6MODMA\u548cPRED+CT\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MDD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u83b7\u53d6\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdbMDD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTF-MCL\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u878d\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5934(FMH)\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u793a\u5728\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u53ca\u878d\u5408\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08MODMA\u548cPRED+CT\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86TF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865.87%\u548c9.96%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "TF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8de8\u57df\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728MDD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Hasib Ur Rahman"], "title": "The Laminar Flow Hypothesis: Detecting Jailbreaks via Semantic Turbulence in Large Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, the challenge of securing them against adversarial \"jailbreaking\" attacks has intensified. Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c42\u6d41\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u5c42\u95f4\u4f59\u5f26\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6e4d\u6d41\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d8a\u72f1\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u4f5c\u5bf9\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u5e95\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u666e\u904d\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u514d\u53d7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u201c\u8d8a\u72f1\u201d\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4e5f\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6216\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5185\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5c42\u6d41\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4f1a\u5728LLM\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u5219\u4f1a\u7531\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51b2\u7a81\u5f15\u53d1\u6df7\u4e71\u4e14\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5ea6\u91cf\u2014\u2014\u5c42\u95f4\u4f59\u5f26\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u7387\u88ab\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ecf\u8fc7RLHF\u8c03\u6574\u7684Qwen2-1.5B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u5230\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u5176\u6e4d\u6d41\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u4e8675.4%\uff1b\u800cGemma-2B\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u8868\u73b0\u51fa22.0%\u7684\u6e4d\u6d41\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u524d\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u51b2\u7a81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5219\u662f\u4f4e\u71b5\u7684\u2018\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u2019\u62d2\u7edd\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u6e4d\u6d41\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u63a2\u6d4b\u5668\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u5f0f\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u67b6\u6784\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}}

Submitted to IEEE IATMSI-2026 (Track: AI, IoT and Computer Vision Enabled Technologies)", "summary": "Financial sentiment analysis enhances market understanding; however, standard natural language processing approaches encounter significant challenges when applied to small datasets. This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification.

We study constrained policy learning where model parameters must satisfy unknown, rollout-based safety constraints. We propose SCPO, a sampling-based weight-space projection method that enforces safety directly in parameter space without requiring gradient access to the constraint functions. Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup. On regression with harmful supervision and a constrained double-integrator task with malicious expert, our approach consistently rejects unsafe updates, maintains feasibility throughout training, and achieves meaningful primal objective improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5SCPO\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u7ea6\u675f\u51fd\u6570\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c55\u5f00\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u754c\u9650\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u51f8\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212\uff08SOCP\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u4fdd\u4ece\u4efb\u4f55\u5b89\u5168\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6240\u6709\u4e2d\u95f4\u7b56\u7565\u90fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u5907\u4efd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u63a7\u5236\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u51fa\u4fdd\u5b88\u5907\u4efd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u65e2\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u4e0d\u4f1a\u79bb\u5f00\u5b89\u5168\u64cd\u4f5c\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5fc5\u987b\u6ee1\u8db3\u672a\u77e5\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SCPO\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u7ea6\u675f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5c31\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u6eda\u52a8\u4e0e\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u6784\u9020\u5c40\u90e8\u5b89\u5168\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51f8\u4e8c\u9636\u9525\u89c4\u5212(SOCP)\u5bf9\u6bcf\u6b21\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u68af\u5ea6\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u6709\u6709\u5bb3\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u8fd8\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u6076\u610f\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u53cc\u79ef\u5206\u5668\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "SCPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u6216\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

A Preprint", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP)\u7684\u65b0AI\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u660e\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5546(ARQ)\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u624e\u5b9e\u7684AI\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5728\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u540e\u95e8\u6ce8\u5165\u548c\u6076\u610f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684AI\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0d\u53d7\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7ad9\u5f97\u4f4f\u811a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884cAI\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ)\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u8f68\u9053\u5927\u5c0f\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8f68\u9053\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884cAI\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5bf9\u624b\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u5584\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea0\u6b63\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLHF\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53d6\u6d88\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u5584\u54cd\u5e94\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdbRLHF\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u901a\u8fc7RLHF\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u539f\u56e0\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0d\u6ee1\u7ed3\u679c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u540e\u9a8c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\uff1b2) \u975e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u9664\u5f15\u8d77\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u5584\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6ee1\u610f\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u53d7\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8RLHF\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8eRLHF\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u6ee1\u610f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u539f\u56e0\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

However, deployment of such solutions is limited by privacy concerns around audio data, sensitivity to background noise, and domain shift across recording environments. We present an end-to-end infant cry analysis pipeline that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained using communication-efficient federated learning (FL). The system performs on-device denoising, adaptive segmentation, post hoc calibration, and energy-based out-of-distribution (OOD) abstention. Federated training employs a regularized control variate update with 8-bit adapter deltas under secure aggregation. Using the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets with ESC-50 noise overlays, the model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, an AUC of 0.962, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.032, while reducing per-round client upload from approximately 36 to 42 MB to 3.3 MB. Real-time edge inference on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4 GB, TensorRT FP16) achieves 96 ms per one-second spectrogram frame.

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aOPTIMA\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u884c\u7ea7\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4f53\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u7f6e\u96f6\u65b9\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u4f46\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4f46\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014OPTIMA\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5c42\u95f4\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u5efa\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u884c\u7ea7\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\uff08QP\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5171\u4eab\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9bQP\u95ee\u9898\u5f97\u5230\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4f30\u8ba1Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u4e0b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u884c\u5411\u91cf\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u53cb\u597d\u7684QP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u6267\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u526a\u679d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOPTIMA\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u63a9\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u53ca\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe3.97%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e80\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728NVIDIA H100\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528OPTIMA\u5b8c\u6210\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u526a\u679d\u4ec5\u970040\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e3a60GB\u3002", "conclusion": "OPTIMA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5355\u6b21\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u751f\u6210\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u9012\u51cf\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9650\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u4f7f\u5f97\u62e5\u6709\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u6587\u672c\u91cf\u8fdc\u8d85\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5229\u7528\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u6269\u5c55LLM\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6c99\u7bb1\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8003\u5bdf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b56\u7565\u5b58\u5728\u8fc5\u901f\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u5e76\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5931\u6548\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u81ea\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u52a0\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8eQwen3-4B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728LongBench-v2\u548cZeroScrolls\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8612.6\u548c14.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bd4\u76ee\u524d\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u3001\u4f9d\u9760\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u601d\u8003\u6807\u8bb0\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6269\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u4f53\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff082RDM\uff09\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u660e\u786e\u4e09\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u73b02RDM\u7684\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4e24\u4f53\u548c\u4e09\u4f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u76ae\u5c14\u68ee\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6ca1\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u65f6\u57df\u5c40\u90e8\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6838\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u795e\u7ecfODE\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u95ed\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u7acb\u662f\u8bb8\u591a\u65b0\u5174\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7cbe\u786e\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u968f\u7740\u7c92\u5b50\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff1b\u800c\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u4e24\u4f53\u5173\u8054\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u4e24\u4f53\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff08TD2RDM\uff09\u5f62\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e2d\u95f4\u5730\u5e26\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4f20\u64ad2RDM\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u4f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u91cd\u6784\u6765\u5173\u95edBBGKY\u5c42\u7ea7\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u5ffd\u7565\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u91cd\u6784\u6cdb\u51fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u76842RDM\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u65e0\u964d\u7ef4\u5904\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u663e\u5f0f\u4e09\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u518d\u73b02RDM\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4f53\u4e0e\u4e09\u4f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u95f4\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u5185\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u590d\u52362RDM\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4f53\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u80fd\u591f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u57fa\u4e8e\u77ac\u65f6\u4e24\u4f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u4e09\u4f53\u5173\u8054\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u6700\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u5f53\u8fd9\u79cd\u79ef\u7d2f\u9002\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u795e\u7ecfODE\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd8\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7684TD2RDM\u91cd\u6784\u90fd\u76f8\u5f53\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u79ef\u7d2f\u8f83\u5f3a\uff0c\u5219\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5931\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecfODE\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6RDM\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e3a\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u67d0\u4e9b\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u6784\u5efa\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u578b\u5185\u6838\u5230\u4e09\u4f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u91cd\u6784\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecfODE\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6620\u5c04\u7d2f\u79ef\u5c55\u5f00\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u95ed\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We introduce a hierarchical decomposition framework for linear recurrences that allows us to develop algorithms aligned with GPU memory hierarchies, yielding Sliding Window Recurrences. We focus specifically on truncating recurrences to hardware-aligned windows which are naturally jagged, limiting costly inter-warp communication. Using SWR, we develop Phalanx layers that serve as drop-in replacements for windowed attention or linear recurrences.

However, few existing methods account for recurring structures, or patterns, that appear within the data. We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty. We apply our method to two well-motivated forecasting applications, predicting visual field measurements and motion capture frames. On both, we show that pattern guidance improves PGDM's performance (MAE / CRPS) by up to 40.67% / 56.26% and 14.12% / 14.10%, respectively.

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework.

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance.

However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.\n  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

Herein, random-bridges can act as stochastic transports between two probability distributions when appropriately initialized, and can display either Markovian or non-Markovian, and either continuous, discontinuous or hybrid patterns depending on the driving process. We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing. Our empirical results, built on Gaussian random bridges, produce high-quality samples in significantly fewer steps compared to traditional approaches, while achieving competitive Frechet inception distance scores.

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection.

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684RD\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u65bd\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u548c\u589e\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u5f97PDE\u7684\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u7684RD\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5e94-\u6269\u6563\uff08RD\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684RD\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u539f\u5219\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u8bf8\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u89e3\u4e5f\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u6781\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u552f\u4e00\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u6784\u9020\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u51c6\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

FLAME utilizes the Legendre Memory for strong generalization capabilities. Through adapting variants of Legendre Memory, i.e., translated Legendre (LegT) and scaled Legendre (LegS), in the Encoding and Decoding phases, FLAME can effectively capture the inherent inductive bias within data and make efficient long-range inferences. To enhance the accuracy of probabilistic forecasting while keeping efficient, FLAME adopts a Normalization Flow based forecasting head, which can model the arbitrarily intricate distributions over the forecasting horizon in a generative manner. Comprehensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks, including TSFM-Bench and ProbTS, demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of FLAME on both deterministic and probabilistic forecasting tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86FLAME\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Legendre Memory\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eNormalization Flow\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFLAME\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u8f7b\u91cf\u53c8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFLAME\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u4e86Legendre Memory\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u53d8\u4f53LegT\u548cLegS\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5dee\u6355\u6349\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eNormalization Flow\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728TSFM-Bench\u548cProbTS\u7b49\u516c\u8ba4\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cFLAME\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAME\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6982\u7387\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Our framework establishes a rigorous mathematical connection between canary offset and trace distance bounds, deriving empirical lower bounds on privacy budget consumption that bridge the critical gap between theoretical guarantees and practical privacy verification.

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_\u03c6$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out. We release the benchmark, preprocessing scripts, and forecasting results to facilitate standardized empirical evaluation and reproducibility in power grid load forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GRAFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86STanHOP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u9884\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u65e5\u6c47\u603b\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d1f\u8377\u4e25\u683c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u878d\u5408\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u50a8\u63a5\u53e3\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGRAFT\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bfb\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8d1f\u8377\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u7ea7\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u53d7\u5230\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65e5\u5386\u8282\u594f\u3001\u7a81\u53d1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u7b49\u5916\u751f\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f71\u54cd\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u529b\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGRAFT\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8eSTanHOP\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u591a\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u5e72\u9884\u3002GRAFT\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6bcf\u5929\u805a\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u4ee5\u53ca\u653f\u7b56\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u6bcf\u534a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u6570\u636e\u7d27\u5bc6\u5bf9\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6eda\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5bfc\u878d\u5408\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0cGRAFT\u8fd8\u914d\u5907\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u5f0f\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u63a5\u53e3\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u63a5\u5165\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6e90\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cGRAFT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u51e0\u4e2a\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u533a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u7531\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u8fd8\u53ef\u4ee5\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u54ea\u4e9b\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u8d1f\u8377\u53d8\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u5177\u4f53\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86GRAFT\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6e90\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8377\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u811a\u672c\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We introduce ClimaX-LETKF, the first purely data-driven ML-based ensemble weather forecasting system. It operates stably over multiple years, independently of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, by assimilating the NCEP ADP Global Upper Air and Surface Weather Observations. The system demonstrates greater stability and accuracy with relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) than with relaxation to prior spread (RTPS), while NWP models tend to be more stable with RTPS. RTPP replaces an analysis perturbation with a weighted blend of analysis and background perturbations, whereas RTPS simply rescales the analysis perturbation. Our experiments reveal that MLWP models are less capable of restoring the atmospheric field to its attractor than NWP models.

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(VAE)\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5fc3\u623f\u7535\u56fe(EGMs)\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f53\u8868\u7535\u4f4d(BSPMs)\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u5185\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u914d\u5bf9BSPM-EGM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7279\u5b9a\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8bVAE\uff08VAE-S\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u53ca\u623f\u98a4\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6VAE\uff08VAE-C\uff09\u3002\u751f\u6210\u7684EGMs\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u4e0b\u6e38\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027EGM\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u623f\u98a4(AF)\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e2d\u6700\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u8bca\u65ad\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5fc3\u623f\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u5316\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5fc3\u7535\u6210\u50cf(ECGI)\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f53\u8868\u7535\u4f4d(BSPMs)\u4e2d\u7684\u5fc3\u5185\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe(EGMs)\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u8fdb\u5c55\u53d7\u5230\u4e86\u914d\u5bf9BSPM-EGM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6709\u9650\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7684\u963b\u788d\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(VAEs)\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5fc3\u623fEGMs\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(VAE)\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u4e13\u4e3a\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684VAE-S\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u548c\u623f\u98a4\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6VAE-C\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5fc3\u623f\u7535\u56fe(EGMs)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u7684EGMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u6269\u589e\u624b\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u7eed\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027EGM\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cVAE-S\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6a21\u62dfEGMs\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff1b\u800cVAE-C\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5b9a\u8282\u5f8b\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u91cd\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6982\u5ff5\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f53\u628a\u751f\u6210\u7684EGMs\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027EGM\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u5177\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u6210\u50cf(ECGI)\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6269\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8ECGI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability.

Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5QR-MAX\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u5956\u52b1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08NMRDPs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5c06\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u5956\u52b1\u5904\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u5f00\u6765\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5cNMRDPs\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0PAC\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u03b5-\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684RL\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Bucket-QR-MAX\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5386\u53f2\u800c\u975e\u8fbe\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u671f\u671b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5904\u7406\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u5956\u52b1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aQR-MAX\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563NMRDP\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u673a\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u5956\u52b1\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Bucket-QR-MAX\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8eSimHash\u8fdb\u884c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u7f51\u683c\u5212\u5206\u6216\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u7684QR-MAX\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53Bucket-QR-MAX\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u5956\u52b1\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u53ca\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

Govindasamy, Mangaliso Mngomezulu, Jonas Weiss", "summary": "We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\u0394$ are provided.

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6570\uff08EWI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u75c7\u76d1\u62a4\u75c5\u623f\uff08ICU\uff09\u5165\u9662\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u56e2\u961f\u6d3e\u9063\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u8bbe\u5b9a\u8b66\u6212\u9608\u503c\u4e0e\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bc6\u522b\u9a71\u52a8\u6bcf\u4f4d\u60a3\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u5728\u4e00\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u7f8e\u56fd\u533b\u9662\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e860.796\u7684C\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7ba1\u7406\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ca\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u533b\u9662\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63d0\u524d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6709\u6076\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u62a4\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u533b\u751f\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u683c\u5f0f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u65e2\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u662f\u4e00\u9879\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6570(EWI)\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5305\u62ecICU\u5165\u9662\u3001\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u5c0f\u7ec4\u6d3e\u9063\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b7b\u4ea1\u5728\u5185\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5b9a\u8b66\u62a5\u9608\u503c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8bfb\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528SHAP\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u5f71\u54cd\u6bcf\u4f4d\u60a3\u8005\u98ce\u9669\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u7f8e\u56fd\u533b\u966218,633\u540d\u72ec\u7279\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0cEWI\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u52300.796\u7684C\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u8bca\u5de5\u5177\u5df2\u88ab\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ba1\u7406\u9ad8\u5371\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u98ce\u9669\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f7f\u533b\u751f\u80fd\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u75c5\u4eba\u62a4\u7406\u800c\u975e\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684EWI\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u6765\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e2e\u52a9\u6539\u5584\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u540e\u7eed\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u5982\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u518d\u5165\u9662\u7387\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u60a3\u8005\u6d41\u52a8\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}
