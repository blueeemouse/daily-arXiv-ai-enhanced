However, acquiring real-world SQL queries is notoriously challenging due to strict privacy regulations. While cloud database vendors have begun releasing anonymized performance traces to the research community, these traces typi- cally provide only high-level execution statistics without the origi- nal query text or data, which is insufficient for scenarios that require actual execution. Existing tools fail to capture fine-grained perfor- mance patterns or generate runnable workloads that reproduce these public traces with both high fidelity and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ResQ, a fine-grained workload synthesis sys- tem designed to generate executable SQL workloads that faithfully match the per-query execution targets and operator distributions of production traces. ResQ constructs execution-aware query graphs, instantiates them into SQL via Bayesian Optimization-driven pred- icate search, and explicitly models workload repetition through reuse at both exact-query and parameterized-template levels. To ensure practical scalability, ResQ combines search-space bounding with lightweight local cost models to accelerate optimization. Ex- periments on public cloud traces (Snowset, Redset) and a newly released industrial trace (Bendset) demonstrate that ResQ signif- icantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 96.71% token savings and a 86.97% reduction in runtime, while lowering maximum Q-error by 14.8x on CPU time and 997.7x on scanned bytes, and closely matching operator composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResQ, a system for synthesizing fine-grained and executable SQL workloads, accurately replicates the performance characteristics of real-world database traces, outperforming existing methods in terms of efficiency and fidelity.", "motivation": "The motivation behind this paper is to address the challenge of acquiring realistic SQL queries for database research and development, especially given privacy concerns. The authors aim to develop a solution that can generate executable workloads mirroring the execution targets and operator distributions found in production traces, something current tools fail to do effectively.", "method": "The proposed method involves the creation of ResQ, a system designed to synthesize SQL workloads that closely match the per-query execution metrics and patterns of actual database traces. This is achieved by constructing execution-aware query graphs, converting them into SQL using Bayesian Optimization for predicate search, and modeling workload repetition through exact-query and parameterized-template reuse. To maintain scalability, ResQ employs strategies like bounding the search space and using lightweight local cost models.", "result": "Experiments conducted on public cloud (Snowset, Redset) and an industrial (Bendset) trace showed that ResQ significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods. It achieves 96.71% savings in tokens and reduces runtime by 86.97%, while also drastically lowering maximum Q-error\u2014by 14.8 times for CPU time and 997.7 times for scanned bytes. Additionally, it closely matches the operator composition of the original traces.", "conclusion": "The paper concludes that ResQ successfully bridges the gap between the need for realistic, executable SQL workloads and the limitations imposed by privacy regulations, offering a more efficient and accurate alternative to existing solutions."}}

Ensuring resiliency, the ability to withstand and rapidly recover from failures, together with operational stability, which provides consistent and predictable performance under normal conditions, is essential for meeting strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs). However, achieving resiliency and stability in large-scale production environments remains challenging due to the cluster scale, business diversity, and significant operational overhead. In this work, we present StreamShield, a production-proven resiliency solution deployed in ByteDance's Flink clusters. Designed along complementary perspectives of the engine and cluster, StreamShield introduces key techniques to enhance resiliency, covering runtime optimization, fine-grained fault-tolerance, hybrid replication strategy, and high availability under external systems. Furthermore, StreamShield proposes a robust testing and deployment pipeline that ensures reliability and robustness in production releases. Extensive evaluations on a production cluster demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of techniques proposed by StreamShield.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86StreamShield\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5b57\u8282\u8df3\u52a8\u7684Flink\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u3001\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u590d\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5065\u58ee\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u96c6\u7fa4\u89c4\u6a21\u5927\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u64cd\u4f5c\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u6c34\u5e73\u76ee\u6807\uff08SLO\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aStreamShield\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0e\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u4f46\u4e0d\u9650\u4e8e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bb9\u9519\u673a\u5236\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u590d\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u53ca\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7a33\u56fa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53d1\u5e03\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u96c6\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cStreamShield\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6280\u672f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5176\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "StreamShield\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21DSPSs\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e25\u683c\u7684SLO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Since its second wave, ADNI has increasingly collected resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), a valuable resource for discovering brain connectivity changes predictive of cognitive decline and AD. A major barrier to its use is the considerable variability in acquisition protocols and data quality, compounded by missing imaging sessions and inconsistencies in how functional scans temporally align with clinical assessments. As a result, many studies only utilize a small subset of the total rs-fMRI data, limiting statistical power, reproducibility, and the ability to study longitudinal functional brain changes at scale. Here, we describe a pipeline for ADNI rs-fMRI data that encompasses the download of necessary imaging and clinical data, temporally aligning the clinical and imaging data, preprocessing, and quality control. We integrate data curation and preprocessing across all ADNI sites and scanner types using a combination of open-source software (Clinica, fMRIPrep, and MRIQC) and bespoke tools. Quality metrics and reports are generated for each subject and session to facilitate rigorous data screening. All scripts and configuration files are available to enable reproducibility. The pipeline, which currently supports ADNI-GO, ADNI-2, and ADNI-3 data releases, outputs high-quality rs-fMRI time series data adhering to the BIDS-derivatives specification. This protocol provides a transparent and scalable framework for curating and utilizing ADNI fMRI data, empowering large-scale functional biomarker discovery and integrative multimodal analyses in Alzheimer's disease research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5904\u7406ADNI\u9759\u606f\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u4e0b\u8f7d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u4f1a\u8bdd\u53ca\u529f\u80fd\u626b\u63cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u5b66\u8ba1\u5212\uff08ADNI\uff09\u9759\u606f\u6001\u529f\u80fd\u78c1\u5171\u632f\u6210\u50cf\uff08rs-fMRI\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u4ece\u5f71\u50cf\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8f7d\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u5185\u7684ADNI rs-fMRI\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\uff08Clinica, fMRIPrep, MRIQC\uff09\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6240\u6709ADNI\u7ad9\u70b9\u53ca\u626b\u63cf\u5668\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u7406\u4e0e\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u548c\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u62a5\u544a\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b5b\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6d41\u7a0b\u652f\u6301ADNI-GO\u3001ADNI-2\u548cADNI-3\u6570\u636e\u53d1\u5e03\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8f93\u51fa\u7b26\u5408BIDS\u884d\u751f\u89c4\u683c\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfrs-fMRI\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u811a\u672c\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u900f\u660e\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5229\u7528ADNI fMRI\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u53ca\u6574\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We present Constitutional Spec-Driven Development, a methodology that embeds non-negotiable security principles into the specification layer, ensuring AI-generated code adheres to security requirements by construction rather than inspection. Our approach introduces a Constitution: a versioned, machine-readable document encoding security constraints derived from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities and regulatory frameworks. We demonstrate the methodology through a banking microservices application, selected as a representative example domain due to its stringent regulatory and security requirements, implementing customer management, account operations, and transaction processing. The methodology itself is domain-agnostic. The implementation addresses 10 critical CWE vulnerabilities through constitutional constraints with full traceability from principles to code locations. Our case study shows that constitutional constraints reduce security defects by 73% compared to unconstrained AI generation while maintaining developer velocity.

However, the conventional NS iteration suffers from inefficiency and instability. Although various improvements have been introduced to NS iteration, they fail to deviate from the conventional iterative paradigm, which could increase computation burden largely due to the matrix products along the long dimension repeatedly. To address this, we consolidate the iterative structure into a unified framework, named Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO). To do so, we could avoid a polynomial expansion. Instead, we evaluate the role of each matrix power, remove the insignificant terms, and provide a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients. These learnable coefficients are then optimized, and achieve an outstanding performance with stable convergence.

Moreover, existing optimization frameworks typically maximize short-term signals (e.g., clicks, same-day revenue) because long-term satisfaction metrics (e.g., expected two-week revenue) involve delayed feedback and challenging long-horizon credit attribution. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Whole-Page Experience Optimization Framework. Unlike traditional list-wise rankers, our approach explicitly models the interplay between item relevance, 2D positional layout, and visual elements. We use a causal framework to develop metrics for measuring long-term user satisfaction based on quasi-experimental data.

To address this, we propose a novel detection framework based on Toxicity Association Graphs (TAGs), which systematically model semantic associations between innocuous entities and latent toxic implications. Leveraging TAGs, we introduce the first quantifiable metric for hidden toxicity, the Multimodal Toxicity Covertness (MTC), which measures the degree of concealment in toxic multimodal expressions. By integrating our detection framework with the MTC metric, our approach enables precise identification of covert toxicity while preserving full interpretability of the decision-making process, significantly enhancing transparency in multimodal toxicity detection. To validate our method, we construct the Covert Toxic Dataset, the first benchmark specifically designed to capture high-covertness toxic multimodal instances. This dataset encodes nuanced cross-modal associations and serves as a rigorous testbed for evaluating both the proposed metric and detection framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across both low- and high-covertness toxicity regimes, while delivering clear, interpretable, and auditable detection outcomes. Together, our contributions advance the state of the art in explainable multimodal toxicity detection and lay the foundation for future context-aware and interpretable approaches.

While approximating late interaction with single-vector representations reduces cost, it often incurs substantial accuracy loss. We introduce Col-Bandit, a query-time pruning algorithm that reduces this computational burden by casting reranking as a finite-population Top-$K$ identification problem. Col-Bandit maintains uncertainty-aware bounds over partially observed document scores and adaptively reveals only the (document, query token) MaxSim entries needed to determine the top results under statistical decision bounds with a tunable relaxation. Unlike coarse-grained approaches that prune entire documents or tokens offline, Col-Bandit sparsifies the interaction matrix on the fly. It operates as a zero-shot, drop-in layer over standard multi-vector systems, requiring no index modifications, offline preprocessing, or model retraining. Experiments on textual (BEIR) and multimodal (REAL-MM-RAG) benchmarks show that Col-Bandit preserves ranking fidelity while reducing MaxSim FLOPs by up to 5$\\times$, indicating that dense late-interaction scoring contains substantial redundancy that can be identified and pruned efficiently at query time.", "AI": {"tldr": "Col-Bandit, a novel query-time pruning algorithm, reduces the computational cost of multi-vector late-interaction retrievers like ColBERT by adaptively focusing on necessary (document, query token) interactions.

This difficulty stems not primarily from insufficient testing tooling, but from intrinsic properties of storage-system execution, including nondeterministic interleavings, long-horizon state evolution, and correctness semantics that span multiple layers and execution phases.\n  This survey adopts a storage-centric view of system testing and organizes existing techniques according to the execution properties and failure mechanisms they target. We review a broad spectrum of approaches, ranging from concurrency testing and long-running workloads to crash-consistency analysis, hardware-level semantic validation, and distributed fault injection, and analyze their fundamental strengths and limitations. Within this framework, we examine fuzzing as an automated testing paradigm, highlighting systematic mismatches between conventional fuzzing assumptions and storage-system semantics, and discuss how recent artificial intelligence advances may complement fuzzing through state-aware and semantic guidance. Overall, this survey provides a unified perspective on storage-system correctness testing and outlines key challenges", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u9488\u5bf9\u6267\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u9762\u5df2\u6709\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u6545\u969c\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u6062\u590d\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdd\u89c4\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u66b4\u9732\u51fa\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u5b58\u50a8\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u5ba1\u89c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u6267\u884c\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u6545\u969c\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u5e76\u53d1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5230\u5d29\u6e83\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6545\u969c\u6ce8\u5165\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u8fdb\u5c55\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u8865\u5145\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7efc\u8ff0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Despite significant progress, existing methods still face challenges, such as inefficient parameter reuse across tasks, risking catastrophic forgetting when tasks are dissimilar, and the unnecessary introduction of new parameters for each task, which hampers knowledge sharing among similar tasks. To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task. Experimental results consistently show that SAFM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving comparable performance while utilizing less than 60% of the parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SAFM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b0\u65e7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u590d\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSAFM\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u523060%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u53c2\u6570\u590d\u7528\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u76f8\u4f3c\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u9002\u914d\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SAFM\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cSAFM\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3001\u91cd\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6216\u6dfb\u52a0\u7a7a\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff1b\u8c03\u6574\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u7279\u522b\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5c42\u95f4\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u540c\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSAFM\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u4e8e60%\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "SAFM\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\u95f4\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u590d\u7528\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51cf\u5c11\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u6548\u7387\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions. ORDER achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal baselines across property prediction, cross-modal retrieval, and microstructure generation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aORDER\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u90bb\u8fd1\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cORDER\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u5728\u6676\u4f53\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u6750\u6599\u6027\u8d28\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u5374\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6355\u6349\u51b3\u5b9a\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5e8f\u6570\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\u3002ORDER\u786e\u4fdd\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6750\u6599\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5360\u636e\u76f8\u90bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u3002", "result": "ORDER\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u7eb3\u7c73\u7ea4\u7ef4\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u5185\u90e8\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u4e86\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u78b3\u7ea4\u7ef4T700\u7684\u6784\u5efa\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u53ca\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ORDER\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u8fd9\u79cd\u62e5\u6709\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u975e\u5e38\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002ORDER\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e8f\u6570\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4ee3\u8868\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u590d\u5408\u6750\u6599\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Unlike item-focused benchmarks, ALPBench predicts user-interested attribute combinations, enabling ground-truth evaluation even for newly introduced items. It models preferences from long-term historical behaviors rather than users' explicitly expressed requests, better reflecting enduring interests. User histories are represented as natural language sequences, allowing interpretable, reasoning-based personalization.

A fundamental gap exists in understanding how systematic integration of domain knowledge (whether from humans or automated reasoning) can bridge this divide.\n  Objective/Aim: We compare human versus artificial intelligence strategies for generating domain knowledge. We systematically evaluate four distinct architectures to determine if structured knowledge integration enables LLMs to generate effective warm starts for high-dimensional optimization.\n  Method: We evaluate four approaches on MOOT datasets stratified by dimensionality: (1) Human-in-the-Loop Domain Knowledge Prompting (H-DKP), utilizing asynchronous expert feedback loops; (2) Adaptive Multi-Stage Prompting (AMP), implementing sequential constraint identification and validation; (3) Dimension-Aware Progressive Refinement (DAPR), conducting optimization in progressively expanding feature subspaces; and (4) Hybrid Knowledge-Model Approach (HKMA), synthesizing statistical scouting (TPE) with RAG-enhanced prompting. Performance is quantified via Chebyshev distance to optimal solutions and ranked using Scott-Knott clustering against an established baseline for LLM generated warm starts.\n  Note that all human studies conducted as part of this study will comply with the policies of our local Institutional Review Board.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f7fLLM\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u70ed\u542f\u52a8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u6765\u81ea\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fd8\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728MOOT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a(1) \u4eba\u673a\u56de\u5708\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u793a (H-DKP)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6b65\u4e13\u5bb6\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff1b(2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u793a (AMP)\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u987a\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b(3) \u7ef4\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6e10\u8fdb\u7cbe\u70bc (DAPR)\uff0c\u5728\u9010\u6e10\u6269\u5927\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b(4) \u6df7\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6-\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5 (HKMA)\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fa6\u5bdf(TPE)\u4e0eRAG\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u8ddd\u79bb\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Scott-Knott\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u597d\u5730\u652f\u6301LLM\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6458\u8981\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u7ed9\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u51fa\u6240\u6709\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u5c06\u9075\u5b88\u5f53\u5730\u673a\u6784\u5ba1\u67e5\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u3002"}}

This paper systematically examines how validators can exploit multi-core parallelism during both block construction and execution without violating blockchain semantics. We formalize two validator-side optimization problems: (i) executing an already ordered block on \\(p\\) cores to minimize makespan while ensuring equivalence to sequential execution; and (ii) selecting and scheduling a subset of mempool transactions under a runtime limit \\(B\\) to maximize validator reward. For both, we develop exact Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulations that capture conflict, order, and capacity constraints, and propose fast deterministic heuristics that scale to realistic workloads. Using Ethereum mainnet traces and including a Solana-inspired declared-access baseline (Sol) for ordered-block scheduling and a simple reward-greedy baseline (RG) for block construction, we empirically quantify the trade-offs between optimality and runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6838\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u6267\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08MILP\uff09\u516c\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5feb\u901f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e3b\u7f51\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u7f29\u77ed\u533a\u5757\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u603b\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u5c0a\u91cd\u4ea4\u6613\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u6bcf\u4e2a\u533a\u5757\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6838CPU\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5728p\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u533a\u5757\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u7b49\u6548\u4e8e\u987a\u5e8f\u6267\u884c\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u8c03\u5ea6\u5185\u5b58\u6c60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u4ea4\u6613\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9650B\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212(MILP)\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee5\u592a\u574a\u4e3b\u7f51\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Solana\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u58f0\u660e\u8bbf\u95ee\u57fa\u7ebf(Sol)\u7528\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u5757\u8c03\u5ea6\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8d2a\u5a6a\u57fa\u7ebf(RG)\u7528\u4e8e\u533a\u5757\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u533a\u5757\u94fe\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6838\u5e76\u884c\u6280\u672f\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u533a\u5757\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u8003\u8651\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Large language model-empowered multi-agent systems (MAS) present a promising paradigm that enables cooperative reasoning and collective intelligence to combat this threat. However, conventional MAS suffer from an information-drowning problem, where abundant truthful content overwhelms sparse and weak deceptive cues. With full input access, agents tend to focus on dominant patterns, and inter-agent communication further amplifies this bias. To tackle this issue, we propose PAMAS, a multi-agent framework with perspective aggregation, which employs hierarchical, perspective-aware aggregation to highlight anomaly cues and alleviate information drowning. PAMAS organizes agents into three roles: Auditors, Coordinators, and a Decision-Maker.

To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types.

Conventional static binning methods rely on offline statistics of numerical distributions; however, this inherently two-stage process often triggers semantic drift during bin boundary updates. While neural embedding methods enable end-to-end learning, they often discard explicit distributional information. Integrating such information end-to-end is challenging because streaming features often violate the i.i.d. assumption, precluding unbiased estimation of the population distribution via the expectation of order statistics. Furthermore, the critical context dependency of numerical distributions is often neglected. To this end, we propose DAES, an end-to-end framework designed to tackle numerical feature embedding in streaming training scenarios by integrating distributional information with an adaptive modulation mechanism. Specifically, we introduce an efficient reservoir-sampling-based distribution estimation method and two field-aware distribution modulation strategies to capture streaming distributions and field-dependent semantics.

It advances a forward-looking perspective on the next generation of formal methods based on the integration of automated contract synthesis, semantic artifact reuse, and refinement-based theory. We argue that future verification systems must move beyond isolated correctness proofs toward a cumulative, knowledge-driven paradigm in which specifications, contracts, and proofs are continuously synthesised and transferred across systems. To support this shift, we outline a hybrid framework combining large language models with graph-based representations to enable scalable semantic matching and principled reuse of verification artifacts. Learning-based components provide semantic guidance across heterogeneous notations and abstraction levels, while symbolic matching ensures formal soundness. Grounded in compositional reasoning, this vision points toward verification ecosystems that evolve systematically, leveraging past verification efforts to accelerate future assurance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u957f\u671f\u7814\u7a76\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5951\u7ea6\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4ef6\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u63a8\u52a8\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u8d85\u8d8a\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8f6c\u5411\u4e00\u79cd\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u5951\u7ea6\u548c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4ef6\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4f7f\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e3a\u8de8\u5f02\u6784\u7b26\u53f7\u548c\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u5339\u914d\u786e\u4fdd\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5373\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u672a\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u52fe\u52d2\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u8fdc\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u53c9\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d1\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u540c\u5408\u6210\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4ef6\u590d\u7528\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u70bc\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u60f3\u3002"}}

The rationale for SDPA has been based upon \"query, key, value\" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface. This interpretation differs substantially from the concept of \"self-attention\", and provides a strong justification for the use of SDPA for time-series data with time-varying local nonlinear dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7f29\u653e\u70b9\u79ef\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SDPA\uff09\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u5728\u7531\u81ea\u8eab\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u5171\u540c\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u201c\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u952e\u3001\u503c\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u96be\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6570\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u89e3\u91caSDPA\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u5c06SDPA\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7b49\u4ef7\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u628a\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u8f93\u5165\u672c\u8eab\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u516c\u5171\u66f2\u9762\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b0\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u524d\u9988\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDPA\u80fd\u591f\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e3a\u5bfb\u627e\u7531\u4e00\u7ec4\u8f93\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u6240\u5904\u8868\u9762\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u610f\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3aSDPA\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u2018\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3SDPA\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u542b\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u6570\u636e\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Offloading MoE expert parameters to host memory and leveraging both CPU and GPU computation has recently emerged as a promising direction to support such models on resourceconstrained local PC platforms. While promising, we notice that existing approaches mismatch the dynamic nature of expert workloads, which leads to three fundamental inefficiencies: (1) Static expert assignment causes severe CPUGPU load imbalance, underutilizing CPU and GPU resources; (2) Existing prefetching techniques fail to accurately predict high-workload experts, leading to costly inaccurate prefetches; (3) GPU cache policies neglect workload dynamics, resulting in poor hit rates and limited effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose DALI, a workloaDAware offLoadIng framework for efficient MoE inference on local PCs. To fully utilize hardware resources, DALI first dynamically assigns experts to CPU or GPU by modeling assignment as a 0-1 integer optimization problem and solving it efficiently using a Greedy Assignment strategy at runtime. To improve prefetching accuracy, we develop a Residual-Based Prefetching method leveraging inter-layer residual information to accurately predict high-workload experts. Additionally, we introduce a Workload-Aware Cache Replacement policy that exploits temporal correlation in expert activations to improve GPU cache efficiency.

However, even advanced prompting workflows like progressive prompting often leave some requirements unmet. Although methods such as self-critique, multi-model collaboration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been proposed to address these gaps, developers lack clear guidance on when to use each. In an empirical study of 25 GitHub projects, we found that progressive prompting achieves 96.9% average task completion, significantly outperforming direct prompting (80.5%, Cohen's d=1.63, p<0.001) but still leaving 8 projects incomplete. For 6 of the most representative projects, we evaluated each enhancement strategy across 4 failure types. Our results reveal that method effectiveness depends critically on failure characteristics: Self-Critique succeeds on code-reviewable logic errors but fails completely on external service integration (0% improvement), while RAG achieves highest completion across all failure types with superior efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose a decision framework that maps each failure pattern to the most suitable enhancement method, giving practitioners practical, data-driven guidance instead of trial-and-error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6709\u90e8\u5206\u9879\u76ee\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u56db\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u5982\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6ee1\u8db3\u6240\u6709\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf925\u4e2aGitHub\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9488\u5bf96\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9879\u76ee\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e4\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u793a\u5e73\u5747\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\u8fbe\u523096.9%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\uff0880.5%\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5269\u4f59\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5931\u8d25\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u81ea\u6211\u6279\u8bc4\u5bf9\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u6709\u6548\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5916\u90e8\u670d\u52a1\u96c6\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5219\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5931\u8d25\u7c7b\u578b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6839\u636e\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u51b3\u7b56\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u9002\u5408\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u76f2\u76ee\u5c1d\u8bd5\u3002"}}

This work challenges this view by introducing decentralized SGD with Adaptive Consensus (DSGD-AC), which intentionally preserves non-vanishing consensus errors through a time-dependent scaling mechanism. We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima.

However, this paradigm faces three critical limitations. First, there is a misalignment between offline training objectives and online metrics. Offline gains do not necessarily translate to online improvements. Actual performance must be validated through A/B testing, which may potentially compromise the user experience. Second, redundancy elimination relies on rigid, handcrafted rules that lack adaptability to the high variance in user intent and the unstructured complexity of real-world scenarios. Third, the strict separation between fine-ranking and re-ranking stages leads to sub-optimal performance. Since each module is optimized in isolation, the fine-ranking stage remains oblivious to the list-level objectives (e.g., diversity) targeted by the re-ranker, thereby preventing the system from achieving a jointly optimized global optimum. To overcome these intertwined challenges, we propose \\textbf{SCASRec} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{C}orrecting and \\textbf{A}uto-\\textbf{S}topping \\textbf{Rec}ommendation), a unified generative framework that integrates ranking and redundancy elimination into a single end-to-end process. SCASRec introduces a stepwise corrective reward (SCR) to guide list-wise refinement by focusing on hard samples, and employs a learnable End-of-Recommendation (EOR) token to terminate generation adaptively when no further improvement is expected.

While \\texttt{Pytest} offers simpler assertions, reusable fixtures, and better interoperability, migrating existing suites from \\texttt{unittest} remains a manual and time-consuming process. Automating this migration could substantially reduce effort and accelerate test modernization. In this paper, we investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate test framework migrations from \\texttt{unittest} to \\texttt{Pytest}. We evaluate GPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 4 under three prompting strategies (Zero-shot, One-shot, and Chain-of-Thought) and two temperature settings (0.0 and 1.0). To support this analysis, we first introduce a curated dataset of real-world migrations extracted from the top 100 Python open-source projects. Next, we actually execute the LLM-generated test migrations in their respective test suites. Overall, we find that 51.5% of the LLM-generated test migrations failed, while 48.5% passed. The results suggest that LLMs can accelerate test migration, but there are often caveats. For example, Claude Sonnet 4 exhibited more conservative migrations (e.g., preserving class-based tests and legacy \\texttt{unittest} references), while GPT-4o favored more transformations (e.g., to function-based tests).

We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed \"Semantic Tunneling.\" While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the \"Robert Boulton\" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces \"Manifold Unfolding.\" MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an \"Artificial Manifold\" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff08PPL\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u3002\u56e2\u961f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u2014\u2014'\u8bed\u4e49\u96a7\u9053'\u3002\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4f4e\u71b5\u53d9\u8ff0\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5e94\u7528\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff08MNCIS\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\uff08ASNC\uff09\u8bf1\u5bfc'\u6d41\u5f62\u5c55\u5f00'\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u7ef4\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff08PPL\uff09\u6307\u6807\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u76d1\u63a7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9012\u5f52\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cPPL\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22PPL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\uff08N=1500\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4f20\u7edfPPL\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MNCIS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\uff08ASNC\uff09\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff08PPL\u7ea683.9\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e03\u4ee3\u540e\u8fc5\u901f\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u5355\u4e00\u4f4e\u71b5\u53d9\u8ff0\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u2014\u2014'Robert Boulton'\u5947\u70b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u540e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u6548\u79e93.62\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u591a\u6837\u5316\u72b6\u60015.35\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u62b5\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6d41\u5f62\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff08PPL\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8861\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u53caASNC\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u79e9\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u9677\u5165\u4f4e\u71b5\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7ef4\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Nowadays, in ranking optimization, the fairness to item providers is viewed as a crucial factor alongside ranking relevance for users. There are currently numerous concepts of fairness and one widely recognized fairness concept is Exposure Fairness. However, it relies primarily on exposure determined solely by position, overlooking other factors that significantly influence income, such as time. To address this limitation, we propose to study ranking fairness when the provider utility is influenced by other contextual factors and is neither equal to nor proportional to item exposure. We give a formal definition of Income Fairness and develop a corresponding measurement metric. Simulated experiments show that existing-exposure-fairness-based ranking algorithms fail to optimize the proposed income fairness. Therefore, we propose the Dynamic-Income-Derivative-aware Ranking Fairness algorithm, which, based on the marginal income gain at the present timestep, uses Taylor-expansion-based gradients to simultaneously optimize effectiveness and income fairness. In both offline and online settings with diverse time-income functions, DIDRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u2014\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u66dd\u5149\u5ea6\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u5165\u5bfc\u6570\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08DIDRF\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u5ea6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6536\u5165\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u6548\u7528\u53d7\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u56e0\u7d20\u5f71\u54cd\u65f6\u7684\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6b63\u5f0f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u6536\u5165\u5bfc\u6570\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6392\u540d\u516c\u5e73\u6027(Dynamic-Income-Derivative-aware Ranking Fairness, DIDRF)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u5165\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u66dd\u5149\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4-\u6536\u5165\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8fd8\u662f\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cDIDRF\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8003\u8651\u65f6\u95f4\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u6536\u5165\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u2014\u6536\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51faDIDRF\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6392\u540d\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These tests are usually integrated into existing test suites and executed regularly alongside all other tests to ensure that future regressions are caught. Despite this co-existence with other types of tests, the properties of bug-reproducing tests are scarcely researched, and it remains unclear whether they differ fundamentally. In this short paper, we provide an initial empirical study to understand bug-reproducing tests better. We analyze 642 bug-reproducing tests of 15 real-world Python systems. Overall, we find that bug-reproducing tests are not (statistically significantly) different from other tests regarding LOC, number of assertions, and complexity. However, bug-reproducing tests contain slightly more try/except blocks and ``weak assertions'' (e.g.,~\\texttt{assertNotEqual}). Lastly, we detect that the majority (95%) of the bug-reproducing tests reproduce a single bug, while 5% reproduce multiple bugs.

Accepted for publication in the 13th IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2025). To appear", "summary": "Decentralized learning (DL) enables a set of nodes to train a model collaboratively without central coordination, offering benefits for privacy and scalability. However, DL struggles to train a high accuracy model when the data distribution is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) and when the communication topology is static. To address these issues, we propose Morph, a topology optimization algorithm for DL. In Morph, nodes adaptively choose peers for model exchange based on maximum model dissimilarity. Morph maintains a fixed in-degree while dynamically reshaping the communication graph through gossip-based peer discovery and diversity-driven neighbor selection, thereby improving robustness to data heterogeneity. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST with up to 100 nodes show that Morph consistently outperforms static and epidemic baselines, while closely tracking the fully connected upper bound. On CIFAR-10, Morph achieves a relative improvement of 1.12x in test accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. On FEMNIST, Morph achieves an accuracy that is 1.08x higher than Epidemic Learning. Similar trends hold for 50 node deployments, where Morph narrows the gap to the fully connected upper bound within 0.5 percentage points on CIFAR-10. These results demonstrate that Morph achieves higher final accuracy, faster convergence, and more stable learning as quantified by lower inter-node variance, while requiring fewer communication rounds than baselines and no global knowledge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMorph\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9759\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002Morph\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMorph\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5904\u7406\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\uff08non-IID\uff09\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86Morph\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u8282\u70b9\u6839\u636e\u6700\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u540c\u4f34\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u8a00\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u540c\u4f34\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u5165\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u91cd\u5851\u901a\u4fe1\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cFEMNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u8fbe100\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u65f6\uff0cMorph\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u53ca\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6240\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u4e861.12\u500d\uff1b\u5728FEMNIST\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u51fa1.08\u500d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e50\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0cMorph\u5c06\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u4e0a\u9650\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\u5230\u4e860.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "Morph\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u53ca\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u4ee5\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u65b9\u5dee\u8861\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6b21\u5c11\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002"}}

However, existing methods predominantly rely on user-item-outfit interaction behaviors while overlooking explicit representations of clothing aesthetics. To bridge this gap, we present the AesRec benchmark dataset featuring systematic quantitative aesthetic annotations, thereby enabling the development of aesthetics-aligned recommendation systems. Grounded in professional apparel quality standards and fashion aesthetic principles, we define a multidimensional set of indicators. At the item level, six dimensions are independently assessed: silhouette, chromaticity, materiality, craftsmanship, wearability, and item-level impression. Transitioning to the outfit level, the evaluation retains the first five core attributes while introducing stylistic synergy, visual harmony, and outfit-level impression as distinct metrics to capture the collective aesthetic impact. Given the increasing human-like proficiency of Vision-Language Models in multimodal understanding and interaction, we leverage them for large-scale aesthetic scoring. We conduct rigorous human-machine consistency validation on a fashion dataset, confirming the reliability of the generated ratings. Experimental results based on AesRec further demonstrate that integrating quantified aesthetic information into clothing recommendation models can provide aesthetic guidance for users while fulfilling their personalized requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86AesRec\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u7f8e\u5b66\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u670d\u88c5\u548c\u642d\u914d\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u7f8e\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u5230\u670d\u88c5\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f8e\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u670d\u88c5\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7528\u6237-\u5546\u54c1-\u642d\u914d\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u670d\u88c5\u7f8e\u5b66\u7684\u660e\u786e\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AesRec\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u7f8e\u5b66\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u670d\u88c5\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u548c\u65f6\u5c1a\u7f8e\u5b66\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u7ec4\u591a\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5728\u5355\u54c1\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u516d\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u5ed3\u5f62\u3001\u8272\u5f69\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u5de5\u827a\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u54c1\u5370\u8c61\uff1b\u5728\u642d\u914d\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u524d\u4e94\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u98ce\u683c\u534f\u540c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8c10\u5ea6\u53ca\u642d\u914d\u5370\u8c61\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u72ec\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u91cf\u5316\u7f8e\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u6574\u5408\u81f3\u670d\u88c5\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f8e\u5b66\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u5176\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u5b9a\u91cf\u7f8e\u5b66\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684AesRec\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u66f4\u52a0\u7b26\u5408\u7f8e\u5b66\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u670d\u88c5\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u670d\u52a1\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u9700\u8981\u3002"}}

For example, contributions introducing new features are expected to include tests, and contributions with tests are more likely to be accepted. Although most real-world projects require contributors to write tests, the specific testing practices communicated to contributors remain unclear. In this paper, we present an empirical study to understand better how software testing is approached in contribution guidelines. We analyze the guidelines of 200 Python and JavaScript open-source software projects. We find that 78\\% of the projects include some form of test documentation for contributors. Test documentation is located in multiple sources, including \\texttt{CONTRIBUTING} files (58\\%), external documentation (24\\%), and \\texttt{README} files (8\\%). Furthermore, test documentation commonly explains how to run tests (83.5\\%), but less often provides guidance on how to write tests (37\\%).

Under review", "summary": "Asynchronous pipeline parallelism maximizes hardware utilization by eliminating the pipeline bubbles inherent in synchronous execution, offering a path toward efficient large-scale distributed training. However, this efficiency gain can be compromised by gradient staleness, where the immediate model updates with delayed gradients introduce noise into the optimization process. Crucially, we identify a critical, yet often overlooked, pathology: this delay scales linearly with pipeline depth, fundamentally undermining the very scalability that the method originally intends to provide. In this work, we investigate this inconsistency and bridge the gap by rectifying delayed gradients through basis rotation, restoring scalable asynchronous training while maintaining performance. Specifically, we observe that the deleterious effects of delayed gradients are exacerbated when the Hessian eigenbasis is misaligned with the standard coordinate basis. We demonstrate that this misalignment prevents coordinate-wise adaptive schemes, such as Adam, from effectively leveraging curvature-aware adaptivity. This failure leads to significant oscillations in the optimization trajectory and, consequently, slower convergence. We substantiate these findings through both rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation. To address this challenge, we propose the use of basis rotation, demonstrating that it effectively mitigates the alignment issue and significantly accelerates convergence in asynchronous settings. For example, our training of a 1B-parameter LLM with basis rotation achieves the same training loss in 76.8% fewer iterations compared to the best-performing asynchronous pipeline parallel training baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u5f02\u6b65\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u540c\u6b65\u6267\u884c\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6c14\u6ce1\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u589e\u76ca\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u68af\u5ea6\u9648\u65e7\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u635f\u5bb3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u4f1a\u5411\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u6df1\u5ea6\u6210\u6b63\u6bd4\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u524a\u5f31\u4e86\u539f\u672c\u671f\u671b\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u5728Hessian\u7279\u5f81\u57fa\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5750\u6807\u57fa\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u88ab\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u6b62\u4e86\u50cfAdam\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5750\u6807\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u51fa\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u632f\u8361\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u51cf\u6162\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u5feb\u5f02\u6b65\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5747\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u4e0a\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u670910\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4ec5\u970023.2%\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u5ef6\u8fdf\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6b65\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5e76\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u9648\u65e7\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Prior analyses suggest that role-related signals are encoded along activation channels that are largely separate from query-document representations, raising the possibility of steering ranking behavior directly at the activation level rather than through brittle prompt engineering. In this work, we propose RankSteer, a post-hoc activation steering framework for zero-shot pointwise LLM ranking. We characterize ranking behavior through three disentangled and steerable directions in representation space: a \\textbf{decision direction} that maps hidden states to relevance scores, an \\textbf{evidence direction} that captures relevance signals not directly exploited by the decision head, and a \\textbf{role direction} that modulates model behavior without injecting relevance information. Using projection-based interventions at inference time, RankSteer jointly controls these directions to calibrate ranking behavior without modifying model weights or introducing explicit cross-document comparisons. Experiments on TREC DL 20 and multiple BEIR benchmarks show that RankSteer consistently improves ranking quality using only a small number of anchor queries, demonstrating that substantial ranking capacity remains under-utilized in pointwise LLM rankers. We further provide a geometric analysis revealing that steering improves ranking by stabilizing ranking geometry and reducing dispersion, offering new insight into how LLMs internally represent and calibrate relevance judgments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRankSteer\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9010\u70b9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u89d2\u8272\u65b9\u5411\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0cRankSteer\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u6863\u95f4\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u6574\u6392\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u6392\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LLM\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u8bed\u7684\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u89d2\u8272\u626e\u6f14\u6307\u4ee4\u3002\u5148\u524d\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u89d2\u8272\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u6cbf\u7740\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2-\u6587\u6863\u8868\u793a\u5927\u81f4\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6392\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RankSteer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9010\u70b9LLM\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5bfc\u5411\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u8026\u5e76\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u2014\u2014\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u8bc1\u636e\u65b9\u5411\u53ca\u89d2\u8272\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u6392\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u501f\u52a9\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u624b\u6bb5\uff0cRankSteer\u80fd\u5171\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u5411\u4ee5\u6821\u6b63\u6392\u5e8f\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u8de8\u6587\u6863\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "TREC DL 20\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4e2aBEIR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86RankSteer\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u951a\u5b9a\u67e5\u8be2\u5373\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u6392\u5e8f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9010\u70b9LLM\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u4ecd\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5bfc\u5411\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u6392\u5e8f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6392\u5e8f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLMs\u5185\u90e8\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "conclusion": "RankSteer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\u6392\u5e8f\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u63a7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c42\u9762\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e5f\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9LLM\u5185\u90e8\u8fd0\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Jagtap"], "title": "Hypersonic Flow Control: Generalized Deep Reinforcement Learning for Hypersonic Intake Unstart Control under Uncertainty", "comment": "34 Pages, 23 Figures", "summary": "The hypersonic unstart phenomenon poses a major challenge to reliable air-breathing propulsion at Mach 5 and above, where strong shock-boundary-layer interactions and rapid pressure fluctuations can destabilize inlet operation. Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation. These results establish a data-driven approach for real-time hypersonic flow control under realistic operational uncertainties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u9a6c\u8d6b\u65705\u53ca\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570$5\\times 10^6$\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u8fdb\u6c14\u9053\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u542f\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u80cc\u538b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u64cd\u4f5c\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u80cc\u538b\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u975e\u542f\u52a8\u73b0\u8c61\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u5438\u6c14\u5f0f\u63a8\u8fdb\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9a6c\u8d6b\u65705\u53ca\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u6fc0\u6ce2-\u8fb9\u754c\u5c42\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6ce2\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdb\u6c14\u9053\u8fd0\u884c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5185\u90e8CFD\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u6790\u5173\u952e\u6d41\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DRL\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u6d41\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u8fdb\u6c14\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u542f\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "DRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u7a33\u5b9a\u8fdb\u6c14\u9053\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0d\u540c\u71c3\u70e7\u5ba4\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u80cc\u538b\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4ee5\u524d\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e2d\u53bb\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u80cc\u538b\u7ea7\u522b\u3001\u96f7\u8bfa\u6570\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u914d\u7f6e\u7b49\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\u5229\u7528\u6700\u5c11\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d85\u97f3\u901f\u6d41\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u3002"}}

Existing graph-based retrieval approaches typically rely on a uniform similarity metric that overlooks hop-specific semantics, and their rigid pre-defined plans hinder dynamic error correction. These limitations suggest that a retriever should adapt its reasoning to the evolving context and recover intelligently from dead ends. To address these needs, we propose Failure is Feedback (FiF), which casts subgraph retrieval as a sequential decision process and introduces two key innovations. (i) We introduce a history-aware backtracking mechanism; unlike standard backtracking that simply reverts the state, our approach piggybacks on the context of failed traversals, leveraging insights from previous failures. (ii) We implement an economically-rational agentic workflow. Unlike conventional agents with static strategies, our orchestrator employs a cost-aware traversal method to dynamically manage the trade-off between retrieval accuracy and inference costs, escalating to intensive LLM-based reasoning only when the prior failure justifies the additional computational investment. Extensive experiments show that FiF achieves state-of-the-art retrieval on the benchmarks of MultimodalQA, MMCoQA and WebQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFailure is Feedback (FiF)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u627e\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFiF\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8df3\u8f6c\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8ba1\u5212\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u7ea0\u6b63\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u4ece\u6b7b\u80e1\u540c\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Failure is Feedback (FiF)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u5b50\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u521b\u65b0\uff1a(i) \u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5931\u8d25\u904d\u5386\u4e2d\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6062\u590d\u72b6\u6001\uff1b(ii) \u7ecf\u6d4e\u7406\u6027\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6210\u672c\u610f\u8bc6\u904d\u5386\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5148\u524d\u5931\u8d25\u8bc1\u660e\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6295\u8d44\u5408\u7406\u65f6\u624d\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cFiF\u5728MultimodalQA\u3001MMCoQA\u548cWebQA\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5386\u53f2\u611f\u77e5\u56de\u6eaf\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u5206\u6790\u7b56\u7565\uff0cFiF\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

We identify a gap in UT training data: repository-mined tests lack developer CoTs, while LLM-distilled CoTs are often incorrect or incomplete. To address this issue, we propose a novel data-distillation approach that uses self-debugging to produce high-quality UT training examples paired with faithful CoTs. Our approach combines (1) guided test repair, a heuristic loop (error-, failure-, and coverage-focused steps) that asks the used model to diagnose and iteratively fix generated tests, and (2) CoT compression, which compacts original and debugging CoTs into concise explanations that directly justify correct tests. We apply this pipeline to a large corpus of open-source projects to construct a dataset of 74,518 high-quality <focal method, test, CoT> examples, and then use it for supervised fine-tuning of a base model. An empirical evaluation shows that the fine-tuned model achieves high UT generation effectiveness: it attains a pass rate of 36.17% on test assertions, a branch coverage of 43.90%, and a mutation score of 88.66%, substantially higher than state-of-the-art commercial models like o4-mini.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b74,518\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf<\u7126\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5, \u6d4b\u8bd5, \u601d\u7ef4\u94fe>\u6837\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5176\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65ad\u8a00\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u3001\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u53d8\u5f02\u5206\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65ad\u8a00\u53ca\u53ef\u9760\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ece\u4ee3\u7801\u4ed3\u5e93\u6316\u6398\u51fa\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u70bc\u51fa\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u6216\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u70bc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8bd5\u6280\u672f\u6765\u751f\u4ea7\u5e26\u6709\u5fe0\u5b9e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4fee\u590d\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u3001\u5931\u8d25\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\u4e0e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7cbe\u7b80\u539f\u59cb\u548c\u8c03\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u7b80\u6d01\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6d41\u7a0b\u5230\u5927\u91cf\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b74,518\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf<\u7126\u70b9\u65b9\u6cd5, \u6d4b\u8bd5, CoT>\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6b64\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5f0f\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65ad\u8a00\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u53ca\u7a81\u53d8\u5f97\u5206\u4e0a\u90fd\u8fdc\u8d85\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5355\u5143\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5e26\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u65ad\u8a00\u548c\u6709\u7528\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Policy distillation provides powerful tactical guidance but fails to transfer long-term strategic knowledge, while automaton-based methods capture task structure but lack fine-grained action guidance. This paper introduces Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT), a framework that unifies strategic automaton-based knowledge with tactical policy-level knowledge into a coherent guidance signal. CADENT's key innovation is an experience-gated trust mechanism that dynamically weighs teacher guidance against the student's own experience at the state-action level, enabling graceful adaptation to target domain specifics. Across challenging environments, from sparse-reward grid worlds to continuous control tasks, CADENT achieves 40-60\\% better sample efficiency than baselines while maintaining superior asymptotic performance, establishing a robust approach for adaptive knowledge transfer in RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCADENT\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u4efb\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCADENT\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8640-60%\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6218\u672f\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5374\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4f20\u9012\u957f\u671f\u6218\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0a\u4e0d\u591f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Context-Aware Distillation with Experience-gated Transfer (CADENT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u6218\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6218\u672f\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002CADENT\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u72b6\u6001-\u884c\u52a8\u5c42\u9762\u4e0a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u81ea\u8eab\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cCADENT\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8640-60%\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "CADENT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u73af\u5883\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Yet many real-world information needs demand more: enforcement of logical constraints, multi-step inference, and synthesis of multiple pieces of evidence. Addressing these requirements is, at its core, a problem of reasoning. Across AI communities, researchers are developing diverse solutions for the problem of reasoning, from inference-time strategies and post-training of LLMs, to neuro-symbolic systems, Bayesian and probabilistic frameworks, geometric representations, and energy-based models. These efforts target the same problem: to move beyond pattern-matching systems toward structured, verifiable inference. However, they remain scattered across disciplines, making it difficult for IR researchers to identify the most relevant ideas and opportunities. To help navigate the fragmented landscape of research in reasoning, this tutorial first articulates a working definition of reasoning within the context of information retrieval and derives from it a unified analytical framework. The framework maps existing approaches along axes that reflect the core components of the definition. By providing a comprehensive overview of recent approaches and mapping current methods onto the defined axes, we expose their trade-offs and complementarities, highlight where IR can benefit from cross-disciplinary advances, and illustrate how retrieval process itself can play a central role in broader reasoning systems. The tutorial will equip participants with both a conceptual framework and practical guidance for enhancing reasoning-capable IR systems, while situating IR as a domain that both benefits and contributes to the broader development of reasoning methodologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6559\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6982\u8ff0\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u9886\u57df\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u540d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u6ee1\u8db3\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5408\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc1\u636e\u7b49\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u793e\u533a\u6b63\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u52aa\u529b\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5404\u4e2a\u5b66\u79d1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7406\u5ff5\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9996\u5148\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6cbf\u7740\u53cd\u6620\u5b9a\u4e49\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8f74\u7ebf\u6620\u5c04\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u671f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u6982\u89c8\u5e76\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8f74\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\u4e4b\u5904\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5982\u4f55\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6559\u7a0b\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u589e\u5f3a\u5177\u5907\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u4e5f\u8d21\u732e\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Despite the effectiveness, we show that current GR models suffer from a critical \\textbf{bias amplification} issue, where token-level bias escalates as token generation progresses, ultimately limiting the recommendation diversity and hurting the user experience. By comparing against the key factor behind the success of traditional multi-stage pipelines, we reveal two limitations in GR that can amplify the bias: homogeneous reliance on the encoded history, and fixed computational budgets that prevent deeper user preference understanding.\n  To combat the bias amplification issue, it is crucial for GR to 1) incorporate more heterogeneous information, and 2) allocate greater computational resources at each token generation step. To this end, we propose CARE, a simple yet effective cascaded reasoning framework for debiased GR. To incorporate heterogeneous information, we introduce a progressive history encoding mechanism, which progressively incorporates increasingly fine-grained history information as the generation process advances. To allocate more computations, we propose a query-anchored reasoning mechanism, which seeks to perform a deeper understanding of historical information through parallel reasoning steps. We instantiate CARE on three GR backbones. Empirical results on four datasets show the superiority of CARE in recommendation accuracy, diversity, efficiency, and promising scalability.

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details.\n  To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS.

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

To avoid the significant memory overhead of storing large item sets, the generative recommendation paradigm instead models each item as a series of discrete semantic codes. Here, the next item is predicted by an autoregressive model that generates the code sequence corresponding to the predicted item. However, despite promising ranking capabilities on small datasets, these methods have yet to surpass traditional sequential recommenders on large item sets, limiting their adoption in the very scenarios they were designed to address. To resolve this, we propose MSCGRec, a Multimodal Semantic and Collaborative Generative Recommender. MSCGRec incorporates multiple semantic modalities and introduces a novel self-supervised quantization learning approach for images based on the DINO framework.

It typically sets quantization hyperparameters (e.g., scaling factors) based on current-layer activations. Although this method is efficient, it suffers from quantization bias and error accumulation, resulting in suboptimal and unstable quantization, especially when the calibration data is biased. To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead. Experiments show that FAQ consistently outperforms prior methods with negligible extra cost, requiring no backward passes, data reconstruction, or tuning, making it well-suited for edge deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFuture-Aware Quantization (FAQ)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6765\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6821\u51c6\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u91cd\u8981\u6743\u91cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7a97\u53e3\u9884\u89c8\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8f6f\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u672a\u6765\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5c42\u6b21\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFAQ\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316(PTQ)\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u591f\u7406\u60f3\u4e14\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6821\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u6709\u504f\u65f6\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFuture-Aware Quantization (FAQ)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u6765\u5c42\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5f53\u524d\u5c42\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u7a97\u53e3\u9884\u89c8\u673a\u5236\u8f6f\u805a\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u672a\u6765\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u4e00\u5c42\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u597d\u7684\u914d\u7f6e\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u8d2a\u5a6a\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFAQ\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3001\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u6784\u6216\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u975e\u5e38\u9002\u5408\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6613\u4e8e\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002"}}

A Scaling Law for Recognition Limits in VLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent vision-centric approaches have made significant strides in long-context modeling. Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase.

However, application-level generation requires producing a runnable multi-file repository with correct structure, dependencies, and end-to-end executability, and real-world software must satisfy both functional correctness and non-functional quality (e.g., maintainability, security). Existing benchmarks provide a limited execution-based assessment of these requirements at the application level. We ask: Can current LLMs generate application-level repositories that meet both functional and non-functional criteria? We propose RAL-Bench, a benchmark and evaluation framework for application-level code generation. For each task, we distill a concise natural-language requirement from a high-quality reference project, build black-box system tests covering functional and non-functional attributes, and keep only tests that pass on the reference repository to ensure a sound oracle and an end-to-end executable suite. Functional correctness is measured by system-test pass rate. Non-functional quality is measured along five ISO/IEC 25010-inspired dimensions and aggregated with an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)-derived weight vector, with per-dimension diagnostics and baseline-normalized scoring using reference measurements. Across 16 LLMs evaluated zero-shot with greedy decoding, functional correctness is the dominant bottleneck: no model exceeds a 45% functional pass rate under our requirement-driven, reference-validated tests.

The approach addresses three challenges: systematically deriving formal assertions from natural language requirements using templates, orchestrating multiple formal verification tools to handle diverse property types, and integrating formal evidence production into the workflow. Leveraging RoboChart, a domain-specific modelling language with formal semantics, we combine model checking and theorem proving in our approach. Structured requirements are automatically transformed into formal assertions using predefined templates, and verification results are automatically integrated as evidence.

Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684Locate-and-Edit\uff08L&E\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aNorm-Anchor Scaling (NAS)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ea\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528Locate-and-Edit\uff08L&E\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u8fc7\u65f6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fee\u6b63\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u8fde\u7eed\u591a\u6b21\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u540e\u5bb9\u6613\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7a81\u7136\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5ef6\u7f13\u751a\u81f3\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5d29\u6e83\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u4e0e\u88ab\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a(MLP)\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aNorm-Anchor Scaling (NAS)\u7684\u63d2\u4ef6\u5f0f\u89c4\u8303\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cNAS\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684L&E\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5d29\u6e83\u70b9\u63a8\u8fdf\u8d85\u8fc74\u500d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8672.2%\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u884c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u5982NAS\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3L&E\u8303\u5f0f\u4e0b\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Thus, they provide an ambiguous signal about the quality of the code and interfere with the automated assessment of code changes. While a variety of factors can cause test flakiness, approaches to fix flaky tests are typically tailored to address specific causes. However, the prevalent root causes of flaky tests can vary depending on the programming language, application domain, or size of the software project. Since manually labeling flaky tests is time-consuming and tedious, this work proposes an LLMs-as-annotators approach that leverages intra- and inter-model consistency to label issue reports related to fixed flakiness issues with the relevant root cause category. This allows us to gain an overview of prevalent flakiness categories in the issue reports. We evaluated our labeling approach in the context of SAP HANA, a large industrial database management system. Our results suggest that SAP HANA's tests most commonly suffer from issues related to concurrency (23%, 130 of 559 analyzed issue reports). Moreover, our results suggest that different test types face different flakiness challenges.

However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

However, its effect, and specifically the advisable dose, are disputed in both the research and engineering communities. Prior work reports only correlational associations, leaving results vulnerable to confounding factors. Objective: We aim to quantify the causal effect of code coverage (exposure) on bug introduction (outcome) in the context of mature JavaScript and TypeScript open source projects, addressing both the overall effect and its variance across coverage levels. Method: We construct a causal directed acyclic graph to identify confounders within the software engineering process, modeling key variables from the source code, issue- and review systems, and continuous integration. Using generalized propensity score adjustment, we will apply doubly robust regression-based causal inference for continuous exposure to a novel dataset of bug-introducing and non-bug-introducing changes.

Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision.

In the age of AI coding assistants, it has become even more important for both academia and industry to understand how to measure their impact on developer productivity, and to reconsider whether earlier measures and frameworks still apply. This study analyzes the validity of different approaches to evaluating the productivity impacts of AI coding assistants by leveraging mixed-method research. At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work.

This is particularly true in the case of Language Model (LM) enabled systems where the autoregressive nature of token generation introduces variability in latency, energy usage and response quality. These systems, powered by LLMs, are either resource-intensive (if run on-prem) or raise privacy/cost concerns (if leveraged using APIs). While deploying a Small Language Model (SLM) can be resource-efficient, it often falls short in addressing the diversity and scale of real-world requirements. To this, we argue that, rather than relying on any one SLM, leveraging a coordinated fleet of SLMs, each with specialized strengths can enable systems to dynamically adapt to shifting contexts and workload patterns. However, realizing the full potential of such an approach demands intelligent orchestration and continuous adaptation. To this end, we introduce CALM , a self-adaptive orchestration mechanism based on MAPE-K. Our approach continuously monitors user queries, analyzes the QoS metrics of the SLMs, identifies the optimal SLM to be used, routes the query to the identified SLM and further to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency, leverages caching and scheduling to decide the SLMs to be kept in memory. Our evaluation shows that CALM reduces latency by approximately 40% and energy consumption by 50%, while preserving domain-specific task performance when compared to single-LLM baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236CALM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u7f13\u5b58\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLM\uff09\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7ea640%\u548c\u80fd\u801750%\u3002", "motivation": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u6f02\u79fb\u7b49\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c24\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5355\u4e00\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u6216\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5404\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CALM\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMAPE-K\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u9002\u5e94\u7f16\u6392\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5206\u6790SLMs\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u4f18SLM\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u8bf7\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u5b58\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u54ea\u4e9bSLM\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u5355\u4e2a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCALM\u80fd\u591f\u964d\u4f4e\u5927\u7ea640%\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u53ca50%\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528CALM\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u7ec4\u5177\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6574\u4f53\u670d\u52a1\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the problem of routing inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while controlling the labeling error on test instances. We propose \\textbf{HyPAC}, a method that adaptively labels inputs to the most cost-efficient annotation source while providing distribution-free guarantees on annotation error. HyPAC calibrates two decision thresholds using importance sampling and upper confidence bounds, partitioning inputs into three regions based on uncertainty and routing each to the appropriate annotation source. We prove that HyPAC achieves the minimum expected cost with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on the annotation error, free of data distribution and pre-trained models. Experiments on common benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, reducing the annotation cost by 78.51\\% while tightly controlling the annotation error.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HyPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6700\u5177\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6e90\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c1178.51%\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\uff08\u5982\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u7684\u6210\u672c-\u8d28\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u5f97\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHyPAC\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u62bd\u6837\u548c\u4e0a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u754c\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u4e24\u4e2a\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5ea6\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u6e90\u3002HyPAC\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5927\u6982\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b63\u786e(PAC)\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u9884\u671f\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cHyPAC\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1178.51%\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "HyPAC\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e2d\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Bug-finding techniques exist, but without precise API specifications, they produce many false alarms. Existing methods to mine API specifications lack accuracy. We explore using ML classifiers to determine input validity. We hypothesize that tensor shapes are a precise abstraction to encode concrete inputs and capture relationships of the data. Shape abstraction severely reduces problem dimensionality, which is important to facilitate ML training. Labeled data are obtained by observing runtime outcomes on a sample of inputs and classifiers are trained on sets of labeled inputs to capture API constraints. Our evaluation, conducted over 183 APIs from TensorFlow and Pytorch, shows that the classifiers generalize well on unseen data with over 91% accuracy. Integrating these classifiers into the pipeline of ACETest, a SoTA bug-finding technique, improves its pass rate from ~29% to ~61%.

We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples.

The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

At the same time, safety red-teaming has expanded beyond text to encompass audio-based jailbreak attacks. However, an important bridge between textual and audio jailbreaks remains underexplored. In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming.

Standing at the frontier of this effort is Sybil, a deep learning model capable of predicting future risk solely from computed tomography (CT) with high precision. However, despite extensive clinical validation, current assessments rely purely on observational metrics. This correlation-based approach overlooks the model's actual reasoning mechanism, necessitating a shift to causal verification to ensure robust decision-making before clinical deployment. We propose S(H)NAP, a model-agnostic auditing framework that constructs generative interventional attributions validated by expert radiologists. By leveraging realistic 3D diffusion bridge modeling to systematically modify anatomical features, our approach isolates object-specific causal contributions to the risk score. Providing the first interventional audit of Sybil, we demonstrate that while the model often exhibits behavior akin to an expert radiologist, differentiating malignant pulmonary nodules from benign ones, it suffers from critical failure modes, including dangerous sensitivity to clinically unjustified artifacts and a distinct radial bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aS(H)NAP\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bSybil\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u65f6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u75283D\u6269\u6563\u6865\u5efa\u6a21\u4fee\u6539\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u56e0\u679c\u8d21\u732e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1Sybil\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u6b63\u5f53\u4f2a\u5f71\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u4ee5\u53ca\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bSybil\u5728\u6839\u636eCT\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u80ba\u764c\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u80fd\u505a\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u68c0\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86S(H)NAP\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u76843D\u6269\u6563\u6865\u5efa\u6a21\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9Sybil\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9996\u6b21\u5e72\u9884\u6027\u5ba1\u6838\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4e13\u4e1a\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6076\u6027\u80ba\u7ed3\u8282\u548c\u826f\u6027\u7ed3\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b83\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u6027\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u5bf9\u6ca1\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u5f84\u5411\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "S(H)NAP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4e3aSybil\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u53ca\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u5c06\u7c7b\u4f3cAI\u5de5\u5177\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u4e14\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies. Overall, this work demonstrates a methodology for city-specific evaluation and behavioral-tendency comparison of predictive policing systems, showing how such simulations can reveal inequities and long-term tendencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5df4\u5c14\u7684\u6469\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u4e00\u9879\u5168\u9762\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u6280\u672f\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u7531\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u70ed\u70b9\u8b66\u52a1\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u5185\u5b83\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u548c\u51c6\u786e\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u653e\u5927\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u5176\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u7cdf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5de1\u903b\u767d\u4eba\u793e\u533a\u3002", "motivation": "\u9274\u4e8e\u76ee\u524d\u5173\u4e8e\u6d1b\u6749\u77f6\u3001\u5df4\u5c14\u7684\u6469\u7b49\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u5dee\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\u4e14\u4e0d\u591f\u5168\u9762\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5df4\u5c14\u7684\u6469\u5e02\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u70ed\u70b9\u8b66\u52a1\u624b\u6bb5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u786e\u5b9e\u56e0\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u70ed\u70b9\u8b66\u52a1\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u77ed\u671f\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u6bd4\u70ed\u70b9\u8b66\u52a1\u66f4\u4e3a\u516c\u6b63\u548c\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5b83\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u9884\u793a\u7740\u957f\u8fdc\u6765\u770b\u4f1a\u6709\u66f4\u5dee\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u5df4\u5c14\u7684\u6469\uff0c\u6709\u65f6\u5019\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bf9\u767d\u4eba\u793e\u533a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6267\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u4ee5\u5f80\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u57ce\u5e02\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u8b66\u52a1\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ca\u6bd4\u8f83\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u503e\u5411\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u4ee5\u53ca\u957f\u671f\u8d8b\u52bf\u3002"}}

To address task-order effects, HTCL identifies the best intra-group task sequence and integrates the resulting local updates through a Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion, yielding a consolidation step with theoretical guarantees. The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\\%$ to $25\\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\\%$ across random task permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHTCL\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u672c\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5168\u5c40\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002HTCL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\u523025%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u591a68%\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u7ea7\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u652f\u6301\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u672c\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6HTCL\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u6d77\u68ee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u7ec4\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u96c6\u6210\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\u81f3L\u5c42\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4ee5\u4e00\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u4e00\u5c42\u6b21\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u4e0d\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u3002", "result": "HTCL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u653e\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\u81f325%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u56e0\u4efb\u52a1\u968f\u673a\u6392\u5217\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u5dee\u9ad8\u8fbe68%\u3002", "conclusion": "HTCL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

The key idea of EMF is to replace the trajectory consistency constraint, which is difficult to supervise and optimize over long time scales, with a principled linear surrogate that enables direct data supervision for long-horizon flow-map compositions. We derive this approximation from the semigroup formulation of flow-based models and show that, under mild regularity assumptions, it faithfully approximates the original consistency objective while being substantially easier to optimize. This formulation leads to a unified, JVP-free training framework that supports both $u$-prediction and $x_1$-prediction variants, avoiding explicit Jacobian computations and significantly reducing memory and computational overhead.

This practice is suboptimal for maximizing user's utility because the KL regularization may cause the LLM to inherit the bias in the base policy that conflicts with user preferences. While amplifying rewards for preferred outputs can mitigate this bias, it also increases the risk of reward hacking. This tradeoff motivates the problem of optimally designing reward models under KL regularization. We formalize this reward model optimization problem as a Stackelberg game, and show that a simple reward shaping scheme can effectively approximate the optimal reward model. We empirically evaluate our method in inference-time alignment settings and demonstrate that it integrates seamlessly into existing alignment methods with minimal overhead. Our method consistently improves average reward and achieves win-tie rates exceeding 66% against all baselines, averaged across evaluation settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u80dc\u5e73\u7387\u8d85\u8fc766%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d7\u5230\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u7684KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9650\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u6548\u7528\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u7ee7\u627f\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u867d\u7136\u653e\u5927\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2aStackelberg\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u903c\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u81f3\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc766%\u7684\u80dc\u5229\u6216\u6301\u5e73\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5728KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u4e8e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684LLM\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term \"protecting both ends\". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\"\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e24\u7aef\"\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86QuantLRM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9650\u5236\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u62df\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u8ba1\u7b97\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e866.55%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LRMs\uff0cQuantLRM\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u5fae\u8c03\u6536\u96c6\u6709\u6548\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u5e45\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u7cbe\u795e\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u5e45\u5ea6\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b(LRMs)\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a'\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e24\u7aef'\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u548c\u6700\u5927\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u6bd4\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e2d\u95f4\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5047\u8bbe\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3aQuantLRM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9e\u73b0LRMs\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u5e94\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u6765'\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e24\u7aef'\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u4e8c\u6b21\u503c\u4e58\u79ef\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5404\u901a\u9053\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5305\u62ecAIME-120\u3001FOLIO\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u548cGPQA-Diamond\u5728\u5185\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cQuantLRM\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe\u5230\u4e866.55%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u7ecf\u5fae\u8c03\u7684LRMs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u4f2a\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0cQuantLRM\u540c\u6837\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9002\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "QuantLRM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684LRMs\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5df2\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals. Experiments on large-scale solar generation datasets from MISO, ERCOT, and SPP demonstrate that the proposed Copula+CACP approach consistently achieves near-nominal coverage with significantly sharper intervals than uncalibrated aggregation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8ecopula\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u7ad9\u70b9\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8230\u961f\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c16\u9510\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u540d\u4e49\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bf9\u652f\u6301\u7535\u7f51\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8230\u961f\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7531\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b2c\u4e09\u65b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7ad9\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7684\u8230\u961f\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8de8\u7ad9\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5931\u51c6\u800c\u53d8\u5f97\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u805a\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8ecopula\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u6765\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u7ad9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CACP\uff09\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u805a\u5408\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u7684\u5931\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6765\u81eaMISO\u3001ERCOT\u548cSPP\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Copula+CACP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u672a\u7ecf\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u6807\u79f0\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5e76\u4e14\u62e5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c16\u9510\u7684\u533a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Copula+CACP\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u7ad9\u70b9\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u8230\u961f\u7ea7\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u5c16\u9510\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002"}}

While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances. Embedding representation dynamics in projective space connects data analysis with established geometric programs and yields observables that are directly testable in empirical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u5185\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53d8\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u548cFubini-Study\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65f6\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9ad8\u4f30\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u83b7\u5f97\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u589e\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u6355\u6349\u7531\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u7531\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u6216\u4f59\u5f26\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u5b9a\u5750\u6807\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6216\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eFubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u51e0\u4f55\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4ec5\u56e0\u89c4\u8303\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff09\u800c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Fubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u7d2f\u79ef\u51e0\u4f55\u6f02\u79fb\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6cbf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u3001\u4f59\u5f26\u4ee5\u53caFubini-Study\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5177\u6709\u771f\u6b63\u6295\u5f71\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u91cf\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u8861\u91cf\u7531\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u66ff\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f53\u8868\u793a\u5305\u542b\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u9ad8\u4f30\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u800cFubini-Study\u5ea6\u91cf\u5219\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6ce2\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9694\u79bb\u51fa\u5185\u5728\u6f14\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4f59\u5f26\u4e0eFubini-Study\u6f02\u79fb\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u3001\u5355\u8c03\u7684\u91cf\uff0c\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u7531\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u81ea\u7531\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6295\u5f71\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u89d2\u5ea6\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u533a\u5206\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6f14\u53d8\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f2a\u5f71\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002"}}

Low-rank factorization compresses KV projections by writing $W \\approx A * B$, where A produces latent KV states and B can be absorbed into downstream weights. In modern RoPE-based LLMs, this absorption fails: RoPE forces latent KV states to be reconstructed to full dimension, reintroducing substantial memory and compute overhead. We propose RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP), which prunes entire RoPE-aligned column pairs to preserve RoPE's 2x2 rotation structure, restore B absorption, and eliminate reconstruction. Our evaluation on LLaMA-3-8B and Mistral-7B shows that RAP enables joint reduction of KV-Cache, attention parameters, and FLOPs by 20-30%, all at once, while maintaining strong accuracy. Notably, RAP reduces attention latency to 83% (prefill) and 77% (decode) of baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11KV-Cache\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u548cFLOPs\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u538b\u7f29KV\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3RoPE\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u6001KV\u72b6\u6001\u5fc5\u987b\u91cd\u5efa\u5230\u5168\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662fRoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u526a\u4e0eRoPE\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u5217\u5bf9\u6765\u4fdd\u6301RoPE\u76842x2\u65cb\u8f6c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97B\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u4e0b\u6e38\u6743\u91cd\u5438\u6536\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u6f5c\u6001KV\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728LLaMA-3-8B\u548cMistral-7B\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAP\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11KV-Cache\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u53caFLOPs\u8fbe20-30%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\uff0cRAP\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u522b\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6c34\u5e73\u768483%\u548c77%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165RoPE-Aligned Pruning (RAP)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dKV-Cache\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite this progress, the role of sampling mechanisms in shaping refusal behavior and jailbreak robustness remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a fundamental analytical framework for step-wise refusal dynamics, enabling comparison between AR and diffusion sampling. Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \\emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level. This structure enables lightweight inference-time detectors that generalize to unseen attacks while matching or outperforming existing defenses with over $100\\times$ lower inference overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9010\u6b65\u62d2\u7edd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8f83\u81ea\u56de\u5f52(AR)\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u6b65\u62d2\u7edd\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(SRI)\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793aSRI\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5185\u90e8\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u5bb3\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86100\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(DLMs)\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u62d2\u7edd\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u8d8a\u72f1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u7814\u7a76\u9010\u6b65\u62d2\u7edd\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9010\u6b65\u62d2\u7edd\u5185\u90e8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66(SRI)\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u672c\u8eab\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\u6709\u7740\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e00\u56e0\u7d20\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u5916\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cSRI\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u6062\u590d\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8eSRI\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u672a\u77e5\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\uff08SRI\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u548c\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

In contrast to isometric objectives, which implicitly assume manifold flatness, our method learns tangent vector fields whose flows transport all samples to a common, learnable reference point. The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists. Empirically, we obtain correct tangent alignment and coherent global coordinate structure on synthetic manifolds. We also demonstrate the scalability of our method on CIFAR-10, where the learned coordinates achieve competitive downstream classification performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u586b\u5145\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u6d41\u52a8\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u8f93\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u5c40\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5750\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5207\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5750\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u7b49\u8ddd\u76ee\u6807\u5047\u8bbe\u6d41\u5f62\u5e73\u5766\u6027\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u73af\u5883\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8de8\u8d8a\u672a\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u5207\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u7684\u6d41\u5411\u80fd\u591f\u628a\u6240\u6709\u6837\u672c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u70b9\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u9000\u5316\u584c\u9677\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u6536\u7f29\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d7\u5230\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u542f\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u5750\u6807\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5ba2\u89c2\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5b83\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5207\u7ebf\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5750\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728CIFAR-10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5750\u6807\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We study generalized behavior discovery in short multivariate motion snippets from gulls, where each sample is a sequence with 3-axis IMU acceleration (20 Hz) and GPS speed, spanning nine expert-annotated behavior categories. We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps. These results suggest that HDR-based containment provides a practical, quantitative test for generalized class discovery in ecological motion time series under limited annotation and severe class imbalance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6d77\u9e25\u7684\u77ed\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u6267\u884c\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u7c7b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f7f\u7528KDE+HDR\u5305\u542b\u5206\u6570\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u65b0\u9896\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6709\u9650\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u52a8\u7269\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u67d0\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u88ab\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a(i) \u4ece\u6807\u8bb0\u5b50\u96c6\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u51fd\u6570\uff1b(ii) \u5bf9\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u7b7e\u5f15\u5bfc\u805a\u7c7b\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u5019\u9009\u884c\u4e3a\u7ec4\uff1b(iii) \u4f7f\u7528KDE + HDR\uff08\u6700\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u533a\u57df\uff09\u5305\u542b\u5206\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u6240\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u65b0\u9896\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u5b8c\u5168\u4fdd\u7559\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u4ec5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u6c60\u4e2d\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u96c6\u7fa4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7531\u5305\u542b\u5206\u6570\u6807\u8bc6\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u65b0\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u9634\u6027\u5bf9\u7167\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5219\u59cb\u7ec8\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eHDR\u7684\u5305\u542b\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u3002"}}

Our approach introduces a continuous-time model under which regret decomposes into a delay-independent learning term and a delay-induced drift term, yielding a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any algorithm for online linear optimization into one that handles round-dependent delays. For bandit convex optimization, we significantly improve existing regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates. For first-order feedback, we recover state-of-the-art regret bounds via a simpler, unified analysis.

In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Despite their high accuracy, most existing approaches rely on fixed angular expansions, limiting flexibility in weighting local geometric interactions. We introduce Modular Angular-Radial Attention (MARA), a module that extends spherical attention -- originally developed for SO(3) tasks -- to the molecular domain and SE(3), providing an efficient approximation of equivariant interactions. MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications.

What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b(DDMs)\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e0d\u5728\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6-\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5373\u8f93\u5165\u5e94\u88ab\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u8986\u76d6\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u566a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u3002\u5168\u96c6\u8def\u7531\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6700\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6700\u4f73\u6570\u503c\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5374\u6700\u5dee\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a00\u758fTop-2\u8def\u7531\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u51b3\u5b9a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08DDM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u8c03\u67e5\u4e0d\u540c\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u610f\u89c1\u5206\u6b67\u5206\u6790\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e13\u5bb6-\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6-\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u8ffd\u6c42\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u8def\u7531\u7ed9\u90a3\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u80fd\u591f\u8986\u76d6\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u566a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u90e8\u7f72DDM\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u4e13\u5bb6-\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, they often suffer from spatially inconsistent generation, arguably due to the inherent locality of their denoising mechanisms. This can yield samples that are locally plausible but globally inconsistent. To mitigate this issue, we propose sparsely supervised learning for diffusion models, a simple yet effective masking strategy that can be implemented with only a few lines of code. Interestingly, the experiments show that it is safe to mask up to 98\\% of pixels during diffusion model training. Our method delivers competitive FID scores across experiments and, most importantly, avoids training instability on small datasets.

We demonstrate a fine-grained theoretical tradeoff between expressivity and precision: For every p we exhibit a function \u0393, inspired by the equality function, and prove that a one-layer softmax Transformer can compute \u0393, with p bits of precision, but not with p-1 bits of precision.\n  This result concretely explains the widely observed phenomenon of empirical loss of expressivity when quantization is used. Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.\n  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight \"one-bit\" threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5bf9Transformer\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2ap\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u7b49\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u0393\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5355\u5c42softmax Transformer\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528p\u4f4d\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u7528p-1\u4f4d\u8ba1\u7b97\u0393\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u786e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u6210\u5458\u5173\u7cfb\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u6ce8\u610f\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5316\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901fTransformer\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u9610\u660e\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6d89\u53ca\u7b49\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\u7cbe\u5ea6Transformer\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u7ed9\u5b9a\u70b9\u6570p\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u7c7b\u7531\u7b49\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u542f\u53d1\u800c\u6765\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u0393\uff0c\u5355\u5c42softmax Transformer\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5p\u6bd4\u7279\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ee5p-1\u6bd4\u7279\u5b8c\u6210\u540c\u6837\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u76f8\u7b49\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u5e2e\u52a9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u786e\u5b9a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u5927\u91cf\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6cd5\u5219\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7b49\u503c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5c24\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u8c03\u6574\u91cf\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines. We provide an in-depth analysis of the role of reward shaping, advantage scaling, and policy stability in enabling this improvement. Overall, we demonstrate that confidence-based reward design provides a robust alternative to SFT for binary classification.

In such settings, models implicitly induce a likelihood over correct rollouts. However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute. Our results suggest MaxRL is a promising framework for scaling RL training in correctness based settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MaxRL\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u903c\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u3002MaxRL\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6bd4GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a20\u500d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5904\u7406\u4e8c\u5143\u7ed3\u679c\u53cd\u9988\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9996\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9690\u542b\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5c55\u5f00\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MaxRL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "MaxRL\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u6837\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u65cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u53ef\u5fae\u91c7\u6837\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u800c\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u7b80\u5355\u65e0\u504f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMaxRL\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eGRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe20\u500d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cMaxRL\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMaxRL\u662f\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6269\u5c55RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Namely, identify a well-chosen direction depending on the task at hand and perturbs representations along this direction at inference time. While many propositions exist to pick this direction, considerably less is understood about how to choose the magnitude of the move, whereas its importance is clear: too little and the intended behavior does not emerge, too much and the model's performance degrades beyond repair. In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength.

Early detection of swallowing abnormalities, also known as dysphagia, is crucial for timely intervention. However, current diagnostic methods often rely on radiographic imaging or invasive procedures. In this study, we propose an automated framework for detecting dysphagia using portable and noninvasive acoustic sensing coupled with applied machine learning. By capturing subtle acoustic signals from the neck during swallowing tasks, we aim to identify patterns associated with abnormal physiological conditions. Our approach achieves promising test-time abnormality detection performance, with an AUC-ROC of 0.904 under 5 independent train-test splits.

Standard softmax attention entangles these through global normalization, while recent recurrent models sacrifice long-term, order-independent selection for order-dependent causal structure. CAPS combines SO(2) rotations for phase alignment with three additive gating paths -- Riemann softmax, prefix-product gates, and a Clock baseline -- within a single attention layer. We introduce the Clock mechanism, a learned temporal weighting that modulates these paths through a shared notion of temporal importance. Experiments on long- and short-term forecasting benchmarks surpass vanilla softmax and linear attention mechanisms and demonstrate competitive performance against seven strong baselines with linear complexity.

In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5141\u8bb8\u4f7f\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u4f55\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u8239\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001BlendedNet\u98de\u673a\u548cUIUC\u7ffc\u578b\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8239\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f88\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5c0f\u4e8e2%\uff09\u3002\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Existing graph-LLM bridges often adapt the Q-Former-style connector with fixed-length static tokens, which is originally designed for vision tasks. These designs overlook stereochemistry and substructural context and typically require costly LLM-backbone fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and generalization. We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aEDT-Former\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574LLM\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5c06\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Q-Former\u98ce\u683c\u8fde\u63a5\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684LLM\u6838\u5fc3\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86EDT-Former (Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u71b5\u6307\u5bfc\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u5206\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u51bb\u7ed3\u56fe\u5f62\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eLLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8c03\u6574LLM\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u9664\u5916\uff09\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEDT-former\u5728MoleculeQA\u3001\u9762\u5411\u5206\u5b50\u7684Mol-Instructions\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5982TDC, MoleculeNet\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EDT-Former\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA). Motivated by these insights, we finally propose an improved version of the existing LAPO algorithm for latent action policy learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08IDM\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eIDM\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u7684LAPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff08IDM\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4ece\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eIDM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u9884\u6d4b\uff08UVA\uff09\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8eIDM\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672c\u7684LAPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0IDM\u5b66\u4e60\u6bd4\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5728\u4e8eIDM\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8f83\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u7c7b\u4e14\u4e0d\u5982\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u7565\u90a3\u4e48\u968f\u673a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7248\u7684LAPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eIDM\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\u800c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We show that this assumption can fail: Predictions and explanations can be adversarially decoupled, enabling targeted misclassification while the explanation remains plausible and consistent with a chosen reference rationale. We propose TSEF (Time Series Explanation Fooler), a dual-target attack that jointly manipulates the classifier and explainer outputs. In contrast to single-objective misclassification attacks that disrupt explanation and spread attribution mass broadly, TSEF achieves targeted prediction changes while keeping explanations consistent with the reference. Across multiple datasets and explainer backbones, our results consistently reveal that explanation stability is a misleading proxy for decision robustness and motivate coupling-aware robustness evaluations for trustworthy time series tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTSEF\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u89e3\u91ca\u611a\u5f04\u8005\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u76ee\u6807\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u64cd\u7eb5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u66f4\u6539\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u8fdb\u884c\u8026\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u67e5\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e4b\u95f4\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u4eba\u4e3a\u5730\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u4e0e\u6240\u9009\u53c2\u8003\u7406\u7531\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TSEF\uff08Time Series Explanation Fooler\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0e\u90a3\u4e9b\u4ee5\u5355\u4e00\u76ee\u7684\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u65e8\u5728\u9020\u6210\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5e76\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5206\u6563\u5f52\u56e0\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cTSEF\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u67d0\u4e00\u53c2\u7167\u6807\u51c6\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0cTSEF\u5747\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u770b\u4f3c\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u8003\u8651\u5230\u89e3\u91ca-\u51b3\u7b56\u8026\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u5355\u72ec\u4f9d\u9760\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6807\u5fd7\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u8131\u8282\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This perspective neglects the temporal complexity in longitudinal datasets, such as electronic health records, where a user contributes an entire (sub) table of sequential events. While practitioners might attempt to model such data by flattening user histories into high-dimensional vectors for use with standard marginal-based mechanisms, we demonstrate that this strategy is insufficient. Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss. Empirically, our method reduces the distributional distance to real trajectories by over 60% and reduces state transition errors by nearly 50% compared to leading marginal mechanisms while achieving similar marginal fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6PATH\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u884c\u4e0a\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u7eb5\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u5386\u53f2\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aPATH\u7684\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6574\u5f20\u8868\u89c6\u4e3a\u5408\u6210\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u8fc7\u79c1\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u529f\u80fd\u6765\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5236\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPATH\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9519\u8fc7\u7684\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5b9e\u9645\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8ddd\u79bb\u8d85\u8fc760%\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u9519\u8bef\u63a5\u8fd150%\u3002", "conclusion": "PATH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u79c1\u4eba\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8d85\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u800c\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u6309\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u662f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5e72\u6270\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u653e\u5bbd\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u65f6\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u8de8M\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u589e\u91cf\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4(SNR)\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5236\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u566a\u58f0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5982\u679c\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u566a\u58f0\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5219\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u521d\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u5f97\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u8f83\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u653e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5fd8\u8bb0\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\uff08\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6574\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series. These results indicate that CTAF is a strong step toward label-efficient, generalizable EEG-peripheral fusion under temporal asynchrony.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408(CTAF)\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406EEG\u548c\u5916\u5468\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u9c81\u68d2\u7247\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5728K-EmoCon\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCTAF\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u88d5\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u4e09\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u5206\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86EEG\u548c\u5916\u5468\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u626d\u66f2\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408(CTAF)\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF)\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u53cc\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53ef\u9009\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728K-EmoCon\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7559\u4e00\u6cd5\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cCTAF\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u4f59\u5f26\u88d5\u5ea6\u53ca\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u79d2\u7ea7\u5185\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5e76\u4e14\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\u4ecd\u80fd\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cCTAF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u5efa\u6a21\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3aEEG\u548c\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u534f\u8bae\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u679c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5411\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684EEG-\u5916\u5468\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e00\u5927\u6b65\u3002"}}

To this end, we introduce General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW): a data-driven finite element method. We jointly learn a differential operator and compatible reduced finite element spaces defined on the underlying geometry. The resulting model is solved to generate predictions, while exactly preserving physical conservation laws through Finite Element Exterior Calculus. Geometry enters the model as a discretized mesh both through a transformer-based encoding and as the basis for the learned finite element spaces. This explicitly connects the underlying geometry and imposed boundary conditions to the solution, providing a powerful inductive bias for learning neural PDEs, which we demonstrate improves generalization to unseen domains. We provide a novel parameterization of the constitutive model ensuring the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several steady-state PDE benchmarks, and provides a significant improvement over conventional baselines on out-of-distribution geometries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGeneral-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW)\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\uff08PDEs\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u5143\u5916\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u7559\u7269\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u8fd8\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ec4\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u548c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7a33\u6001PDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(PDEs)\u5b9e\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u672a\u66fe\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u6001\u65f6\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86General-Geometry Neural Whitney Forms (Geo-NeW)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u6709\u9650\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fae\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u53ca\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u4e0a\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u7b80\u5316\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u9650\u5143\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u8f93\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u4fdd\u5b58\u7269\u7406\u5b88\u6052\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u5230\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u795e\u7ecfPDE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ec4\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u89e3\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51e0\u4e2a\u7a33\u6001PDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u5f62\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\u3002"}}

We study how small latent perturbations propagate through these flows and show that Jacobian-vector products (JVPs) provide a practical lens on dependency structure in the generated features. We derive closed-form expressions for the optimal drift and its Jacobian in Gaussian and mixture-of-Gaussian settings, revealing that even globally nonlinear flows admit local affine structure. In low-dimensional synthetic benchmarks, numerical JVPs recover the analytical Jacobians. In image domains, composing the flow with an attribute classifier yields an attribute-level JVP estimator that recovers empirical correlations on MNIST and CelebA. Conditioning on small classifier-Jacobian norms reduces correlations in a way consistent with a hypothesized common-cause structure, while we emphasize that this conditioning is not a formal do intervention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fae\u5c0f\u6f5c\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Jacobian-vector\u4ea7\u54c1\uff08JVPs\uff09\u63ed\u793a\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0cJVPs\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u5206\u6790\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51faMNIST\u548cCelebA\u4e0a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b66\u4e60\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6d41\u5982\u4f55\u4f20\u64ad\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6f02\u79fb\u53ca\u5176\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u5168\u5c40\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6d41\u4e5f\u5141\u8bb8\u5c40\u90e8\u4eff\u5c04\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503cJVPs\u6062\u590d\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u7ea7JVP\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6062\u590dMNIST\u548cCelebA\u4e0a\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0JVPs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89c2\u5bdf\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5728\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6570\u503cJVPs\u80fd\u591f\u6210\u529f\u6062\u590d\u5206\u6790\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5982MNIST\u548cCelebA\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684JVP\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "JVPs\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u63ed\u793a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb(MIA)\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u88ab\u7eb3\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u5355\u8f6e\u548c\u96f6\u8f6e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb(MIA)\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\u3002\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\uff08\u4e00\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e26\u968f\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\uff09\u548c\u96f6\u8f6e\uff08\u4e8b\u540e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u786e\u4fddMIA\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u628aMIA\u8bc4\u4ef7\u770b\u4f5c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u5730\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u52a0\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u4f4f\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u3001\u5355\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8fd0\u884c\uff09\u4e0b\u8861\u91cf\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u4e0e\u4f30\u7b97\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5373\u4fbf\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u6cd5\u9891\u7e41\u91cd\u8bad\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06MIA\u8bc4\u4f30\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches. This work establishes CNM as a practical and efficient approach for high-quality vector generation, with potential for broader applications.

However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental \"blind spot\": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to \"peer-review\" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?\n  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer. Individual traces then perform a targeted self-review conditioned on this packet, allowing them to identify specific logical junctions where they diverged from the broader consensus and pivot if their original reasoning is found to be flawed. Final predictions are obtained via confidence-weighted voting over these revised trajectories.

Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \\textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSC3D\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u5fae\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u53ef\u80fd\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u6ede\u540e\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u5373\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3aSC3D\uff08Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u6765\u5171\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u6ede\u540e\u7684\u90bb\u63a5\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u53ca\uff08\u5982\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bdd\uff09\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u65f6\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u56fe(DAG)\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u8fb9\u9884\u9009\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u6ede\u540e\u8fb9\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u8fb9\u7684\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f3c\u7136\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u5373\u65f6\u5757\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u73af\u6027\u6765\u7ec6\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u57fa\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cSC3D\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u6062\u590d\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "SC3D\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6ede\u540e\u548c\u5373\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and require $\u03a9(k)$ layers for $k$-hop reasoning. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal modification adding: (1) edge-type embeddings that inject relational structure into attention scores, and (2) sparse masking that restricts attention to graph-adjacent positions. While RASA has the same asymptotic depth requirements, sparse masking reduces the attention search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ patterns, and edge biases provide explicit relation routing. Empirically, on MetaQA (1/2/3-hop) and WebQuestionsSP, RASA outperforms standard transformers and matches GPT-4 at lower cost, with advantages growing with reasoning depth (+7.1 points on 3-hop). We do not claim formal learnability guarantees; the contribution is empirical validation that minimal structural modifications substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRASA\uff08Relation-Aware Sparse Attention\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u906e\u7f69\u6765\u6539\u8fdbtransformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRASA\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6transformers\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u8df3\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u7535\u8def\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RASA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "RASA\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u8fb9\u7f18\u7c7b\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u4e2d\uff1b2) \u7a00\u758f\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u9650\u5236\u4e8e\u56fe\u76f8\u90bb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u867d\u7136\u5728\u6e10\u8fd1\u6df1\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6transformers\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8df3\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728MetaQA\uff081/2/3\u8df3\uff09\u548cWebQuestionsSP\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRASA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6transformers\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ee5\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eGPT-4\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u968f\u7740\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0cRASA\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u8df3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u9650\u5ea6\u5730\u4fee\u6539\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584transformers\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u5730\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

While foundation models (FMs) trained on massive datasets demonstrate strong generalization by extracting general-purpose features, they can still suffer from scarce labeled data during downstream fine-tuning. To address this, we propose GeLDA, a semantics-aware generative latent data augmentation framework that leverages conditional diffusion models to synthesize samples in an FM-induced latent space. Because this space is low-dimensional and concentrates task-relevant information compared to the input space, GeLDA enables efficient, high-quality data generation. GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains. We validate GeLDA in two large-scale recognition tasks: (a) in zero-shot language-specific speech emotion recognition, GeLDA improves the Whisper-large baseline's unweighted average recall by 6.13%; and (b) in long-tailed image classification, it achieves 74.7% tail-class accuracy on ImageNet-LT, setting a new state-of-the-art result.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGeLDA\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u957f\u5c3e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cGeLDA\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GeLDA\uff08Generative Latent Data Augmentation\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6f5c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7531\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cGeLDA\u8fd8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u8f85\u52a9\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5411\u91cf\u6355\u6349\u4e86\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5b50\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u9879\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a(a) \u5bf9\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u8a00\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u97f3\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0eWhisper-large\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cGeLDA\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e866.13%\u7684\u65e0\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff1b(b) \u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cGeLDA\u5728ImageNet-LT\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8674.7%\u7684\u5c3e\u90e8\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5237\u65b0\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "GeLDA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u3002"}}

These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy. Experiments across 25 pixel-based tasks demonstrate that our proposed confounding-robust augmentation procedure achieves a success rate 120\\% that of confounding-unaware, state-of-the-art offline RL methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5224\u522b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5177\u6709\u6df7\u6dc6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u6df7\u6dc6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u5230120%\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7b56\u7565\u7531\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5e03\u800c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u9690\u5f0f\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u8fdd\u53cd\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u672a\u6d4b\u91cf\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u56e0\u679c\u89d2\u5ea6\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u89c2\u5bdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8be5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5224\u522b\u5668\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u540d\u4e49\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ece\u6709\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u572825\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6df7\u6dc6\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e0d\u77e5\u60c5\u7684\u3001\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684120%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \\textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \\emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \\textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \\textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \\textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures show consistent gains across diverse benchmarks and compression ratios.

In this work, we mathematically show that this naive intuition is not always true: excessive pre-training can computationally slow down fine-tuning optimization. We study this phenomenon for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning on single-index models trained under one-pass SGD. Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence. Our theory thus provides a unified picture of how pre-training strength and task difficulty jointly shape the dynamics and limitations of LoRA fine-tuning in a nontrivial tractable model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u51cf\u6162\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u5bf9\u5355\u7d22\u5f15\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u963b\u788d\u6536\u655b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e0b\u6e38\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u5c55\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u76f4\u89c9\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u4ece\u8ba1\u7b97\u89d2\u5ea6\u51cf\u7f13\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94(LoRA)\u6280\u672f\u5bf9\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21SGD\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5355\u7d22\u5f15\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u8c03\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u6c47\u603b\u7edf\u8ba1\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u523b\u753b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u7ec6\u8c03\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e86\uff0c\u5f3a\u70c8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ecd\u53ef\u5f15\u8d77\u4e00\u4e2a\u5ef6\u957f\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u59a8\u788d\u6536\u655b\u3002\u8fd9\u8bf4\u660e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u7740LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u548c\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020LoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u4f46\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u7684\u3002"}}

The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSCENT\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u7531\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684Bregman\u6563\u5ea6\u88c5\u5907\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u7aef\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SPMD\uff09\u66f4\u65b0\u5bf9\u5076\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u975e\u6536\u655b\u3001\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5373\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u635f\u5931\u88ab\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aLog-Expectation-Exponential (Log-E-Exp)\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u6536\u655b\u3001\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u7b49\u57fa\u672c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u968f\u673a\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014SCENT\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3amin-min\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u5076\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5728\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u7531\u8d1f\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684Bregman\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u6267\u884c\u5bf9\u5076\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u968f\u673a\u8fd1\u7aef\u955c\u50cf\u4e0b\u964d(SPMD)\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "SCENT\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51f8\u95ee\u9898\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86O(1/\u221aT)\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7387\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e86SPMD\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6SGD\u66f4\u65b0\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u5076\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SCENT\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u90e8\u5206AUC\u6700\u5927\u5316\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165SCENT\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6210\u529f\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u71b5\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

They take a model (the stock), fine-tune it into multiple models (the ingredients), and then mix their parameters back into one model (the soup) to improve predictions. While all known soups require supervised learning, and optimize the same loss on labeled data, our recipes for Self-\\emph{Soup}ervision generalize soups to self-supervised learning (SSL). Our Self-Souping lets us flavor ingredients on new data sources, e.g. from unlabeled data from a task for transfer or from a shift for robustness. We show that Self-Souping on corrupted test data, then fine-tuning back on uncorrupted train data, boosts robustness by +3.5\\% (ImageNet-C) and +7\\% (LAION-C).

We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk. Empirically, MC-ETM improves multi-step dynamics fidelity and yields higher normalized returns on standard offline control benchmarks, particularly under irregular dynamics and sparse data coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578bMC-ETM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u786c\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u52a8\u6001\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fdb\u5165\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u652f\u6301\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e76\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM) \u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u6295\u5f71-\u6269\u6563\u8d1f\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u7840\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u3002MC-ETM \u5b66\u4e60\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u8fd0\u884c Langevin \u52a8\u529b\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u96be\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6240\u5b66\u80fd\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5355\u4e00\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1a\u5f53\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u80fd\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u622a\u65adrollouts\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Q\u503c\u7ea7\u5206\u6563\u60c5\u51b5\u65bd\u52a0\u60b2\u89c2\u60e9\u7f5a\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5907\u4efd\u3002", "result": "MC-ETM \u5728\u6807\u51c6\u79bb\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6b65\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7MC-ETM\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

We trace this consistency to a simple linear effect: the shared Gaussian statistics across splits already predict much of the generated images. To formalize this, we develop a random matrix theory (RMT) framework that quantifies how finite datasets shape the expectation and variance of the learned denoiser and sampling map in the linear setting. For expectations, sampling variability acts as a renormalization of the noise level through a self-consistent relation $\u03c3^2 \\mapsto \u03ba(\u03c3^2)$, explaining why limited data overshrink low-variance directions and pull samples toward the dataset mean. For fluctuations, our variance formulas reveal three key factors behind cross-split disagreement: \\textit{anisotropy} across eigenmodes, \\textit{inhomogeneity} across inputs, and overall scaling with dataset size. Extending deterministic-equivalence tools to fractional matrix powers further allows us to analyze entire sampling trajectories. The theory sharply predicts the behavior of linear diffusion models, and we validate its predictions on UNet and DiT architectures in their non-memorization regime, identifying where and how samples deviates across training data split.

Ortega"], "title": "Notes on the Reward Representation of Posterior Updates", "comment": "Technical report, 9 pages", "summary": "Many ideas in modern control and reinforcement learning treat decision-making as inference: start from a baseline distribution and update it when a signal arrives. We ask when this can be made literal rather than metaphorical. We study the special case where a KL-regularized soft update is exactly a Bayesian posterior inside a single fixed probabilistic model, so the update variable is a genuine channel through which information is transmitted. In this regime, behavioral change is driven only by evidence carried by that channel: the update must be explainable as an evidence reweighing of the baseline. This yields a sharp identification result: posterior updates determine the relative, context-dependent incentive signal that shifts behavior, but they do not uniquely determine absolute rewards, which remain ambiguous up to context-specific baselines. Requiring one reusable continuation value across different update directions adds a further coherence constraint linking the reward descriptions associated with different conditioning orders.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u76f4\u63a5\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u4ec5\u7531\u901a\u8fc7\u67d0\u4e00\u6e20\u9053\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u540e\u9a8c\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u5b9a\u76f8\u5bf9\u7684\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u987a\u5e8f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u6bd4\u55bb\u5c42\u9762\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u8f6c\u53d8\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7814\u7a76KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8f6f\u66f4\u65b0\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u786e\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6e20\u9053\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53ea\u6709\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u6e20\u9053\u4f20\u8f93\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u624d\u53ef\u5c06KL-\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u8f6f\u66f4\u65b0\u89c6\u4f5c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u540e\u9a8c\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u540e\u9a8c\u66f4\u65b0\u80fd\u591f\u63ed\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u8a00\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u770b\u5f85\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u5185\uff0c\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u5173\u4e8e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u6301\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002"}}

One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest.

However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5e7f\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ALGD\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662fAugmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5e7f\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u9879\u6765\u5c40\u90e8\u51f8\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u601d\u60f3\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eALGD\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ALGD\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Inspired by distance field modeling, we propose Distance Marching, a new time-unconditional approach with two principled inference methods. Crucially, we design losses that focus on closer targets. This yields denoising directions better directed toward the data manifold. Across architectures, Distance Marching consistently improves FID by 13.5% on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet over recent time-unconditional baselines. For class-conditional ImageNet generation, despite removing time input, Distance Marching surpasses flow matching using our losses and inference methods. It achieves lower FID than flow matching's final performance using 60% of the sampling steps and 13.6% lower FID on average across backbone sizes. Moreover, our distance prediction is also helpful for early stopping during sampling and for OOD detection. We hope distance field modeling can serve as a principled lens for generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Distance Marching\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u66f4\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6539\u5584\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u597d\u7684FID\u5206\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6ImageNet\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u91c7\u6837\u548cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e5f\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u566a\u58f0\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9047\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u5411\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u5230\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aDistance Marching\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u66f4\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u6307\u5411\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\uff0cDistance Marching\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684FID\u8bc4\u5206\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8613.5%\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684ImageNet\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4fbf\u79fb\u9664\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u8f93\u5165\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cDistance Marching\u4ecd\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "Distance Marching\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65e0\u65f6\u95f4\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset.

Many applications demand not just point estimates but interpretable uncertainty. Providing fast inference alongside uncertainty estimates remains challenging yet desirable in numerous applications.\n  We propose the Variational Sparse Paired Autoencoder (vsPAIR) to address this challenge. The architecture pairs a standard VAE encoding observations with a sparse VAE encoding quantities of interest, connected through a learned latent mapping. The variational structure enables uncertainty estimation, the paired architecture encourages interpretability by anchoring QoI representations to clean data, and sparse encodings provide structure by concentrating information into identifiable factors rather than diffusing across all dimensions. We also propose modifications to existing sparse VAE methods: a hard-concrete spike-and-slab relaxation for differentiable training and a beta hyperprior for adaptive sparsity levels. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed architecture, we conduct experiments on blind inpainting and computed tomography, demonstrating that vsPAIR is a capable inverse problem solver that can provide interpretable and structured uncertainty estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u914d\u5bf9\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08vsPAIR\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u76f2\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u6784\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u70b9\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u5f88\u591a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4f46\u503c\u5f97\u8ffd\u6c42\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53d8\u5206\u7a00\u758f\u914d\u5bf9\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668(vsPAIR)\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6VAE\u4e0e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758fVAE\u914d\u5bf9\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u7f16\u7801\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6620\u5c04\u8fde\u63a5\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758fVAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff1a\u786c\u6df7\u51dd\u571f\u5c16\u5cf0-\u6ed1\u677f\u677e\u5f1b\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d1d\u5854\u8d85\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a00\u758f\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u76f2\u4fee\u590d\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86vsPAIR\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "vsPAIR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002"}}

In autoregressive video generation models, the KV cache grows with generation history and quickly dominates GPU memory, often exceeding 30 GB, preventing deployment on widely available hardware. More critically, constrained KV cache budgets restrict the effective working memory, directly degrading long horizon consistency in identity, layout, and motion. To address this challenge, we present Quant VideoGen (QVG), a training free KV cache quantization framework for autoregressive video diffusion models. QVG leverages video spatiotemporal redundancy through Semantic Aware Smoothing, producing low magnitude, quantization friendly residuals. It further introduces Progressive Residual Quantization, a coarse to fine multi stage scheme that reduces quantization error while enabling a smooth quality memory trade off. Across LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, and Self Forcing benchmarks, QVG establishes a new Pareto frontier between quality and memory efficiency, reducing KV cache memory by up to 7.0 times with less than 4% end to end latency overhead while consistently outperforming existing baselines in generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQuant VideoGen (QVG)\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5e73\u6ed1\u548c\u6e10\u8fdb\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9ad8\u8fbe7.0\u500d\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u4e8e4%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dKV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f1a\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u589e\u957f\u800c\u8fc5\u901f\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u5360\u636e\u5927\u91cf\u7684GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff08\u8d85\u8fc730GB\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u59a8\u788d\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53ef\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7531\u4e8eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8fd8\u76f4\u63a5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u5982\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Quant VideoGen (QVG)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002QVG\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7a7a\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u5e73\u6ed1\u5904\u7406\u6765\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u5e45\u5ea6\u3001\u9002\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6848\u2014\u2014\u6e10\u8fdb\u6b8b\u5dee\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u6839\u636e\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728LongCat Video, HY WorldPlay, \u548cSelf Forcing\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cQVG\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff1a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5c06KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6700\u591a\u8fbe7.0\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u4e8e4%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8fc7\u591a\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u592a\u591a\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684QVG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u4e4b\u4e00\u2014\u2014\u5373KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u4f3c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

Classical approaches like differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) add noise to gradients but fail to exploit the unique properties of quantum gradient estimation. In this work, we introduce the Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP), the first privacy mechanism tailored to QML. By leveraging the inherent boundedness and stochasticity of quantum gradients computed via the parameter-shift rule, Q-ShiftDP enables tighter sensitivity analysis and reduces noise requirements. We combine carefully calibrated Gaussian noise with intrinsic quantum noise to provide formal privacy and utility guarantees, and show that harnessing quantum noise further improves the privacy-utility trade-off. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Q-ShiftDP consistently outperforms classical DP methods in QML.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08QML\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u2014\u2014\u5dee\u5f02\u79c1\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u4f4d\u79fb\u89c4\u5219\uff08Q-ShiftDP\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u5185\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cQ-ShiftDP\u5728QML\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u5dee\u5f02\u79c1\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9QML\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u5f97\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Differentially Private Parameter-Shift Rule (Q-ShiftDP)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u4f4d\u79fb\u89c4\u5219\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u68af\u5ea6\u6240\u5177\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8fb9\u754c\u6027\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5141\u8bb8\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5de7\u5999\u5730\u5c06\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982DP-SGD\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Q-ShiftDP\u6280\u672f\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Q-ShiftDP\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6539\u5584\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e13\u7528\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236Q-ShiftDP\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u7406\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u751f\u7279\u6027\uff0cQ-ShiftDP\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing leading approaches, such as Lagrangian methods, typically rely on global penalties or centralized critics that react to violations after they occur, often suppressing exploration and leading to over-conservatism. We propose Co2PO, a novel MARL communication-augmented framework that enables coordination-driven safety through selective, risk-aware communication. Co2PO introduces a shared blackboard architecture for broadcasting positional intent and yield signals, governed by a learned hazard predictor that proactively forecasts potential violations over an extended temporal horizon. By integrating these forecasts into a constrained optimization objective, Co2PO allows agents to anticipate and navigate collective hazards without the performance trade-offs inherent in traditional reactive constraints. We evaluate Co2PO across a suite of complex multi-agent safety benchmarks, where it achieves higher returns compared to leading constrained baselines while converging to cost-compliant policies at deployment. Ablation studies further validate the necessity of risk-triggered communication, adaptive gating, and shared memory components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6Co2PO\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8c03\u3002\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u9ed1\u677f\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u4e3b\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u6f5c\u5728\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u524d\u89c4\u907f\u96c6\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u5148\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCo2PO\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u7b26\u5408\u6210\u672c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u60e9\u7f5a\u6216\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc4\u5224\u673a\u5236\u6765\u54cd\u5e94\u5df2\u7ecf\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u5f80\u5f80\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCo2PO\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8c03\u3002Co2PO\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u9ed1\u677f\u67b6\u6784\u7528\u4e8e\u5e7f\u64ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u8ba9\u6b65\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u8be5\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u8f83\u957f\u65f6\u671f\u5185\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9884\u6d4b\u88ab\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u89c1\u5230\u5e76\u5bfc\u822a\u96c6\u4f53\u5371\u5bb3\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9Co2PO\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u53d7\u9650\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCo2PO\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7b26\u5408\u6210\u672c\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u89e6\u53d1\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u4ee5\u53ca\u5171\u4eab\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Co2PO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53d7\u9650\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5141\u8bb8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u907f\u514d\u6f5c\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, most progress in unlearning has been empirical, with little theoretical understanding of when and why unlearning works. We tackle this gap by framing unlearning through the lens of asymptotic linear stability to capture the interaction between optimization dynamics and data geometry. The key quantity in our analysis is data coherence which is the cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum. We decompose coherence along three axes: within the retain set, within the forget set, and between them, and prove tight stability thresholds that separate convergence from divergence. To further link data properties to forgettability, we study a two layer ReLU CNN under a signal plus noise model and show that stronger memorization makes forgetting easier: when the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is lower, cross sample alignment is weaker, reducing coherence and making unlearning easier; conversely, high SNR, highly aligned models resist unlearning. For empirical verification, we show that Hessian tests and CNN heatmaps align closely with the predicted boundary, mapping the stability frontier of gradient based unlearning as a function of batching, mixing, and data/model alignment. Our analysis is grounded in random matrix theory tools and provides the first principled account of the trade offs between memorization, coherence, and unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6cd5\u89c4\u9075\u4ece\u548c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5173\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\uff08cross sample alignment of loss surface directions near the optimum\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5173\u952e\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u7740\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u5185\u3001\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u5185\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u4e24\u5c42ReLU CNN\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u8ba8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u5f31\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u9057\u5fd8\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\uff1b\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8SNR\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5219\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHessian\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cCNN\u70ed\u56fe\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8fb9\u754c\u7d27\u5bc6\u543b\u5408\uff0c\u63cf\u7ed8\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6279\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e/\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u77e9\u9635\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u76f8\u5e72\u6027\u4e0e\u9057\u5fd8\u4e09\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u53ca\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

However, existing Lean datasets consist almost exclusively of correct proofs, offering little supervision for understanding and repairing failures. We study Lean proof repair as a supervised learning problem: given an erroneous proof and compiler feedback, predict both a corrected proof and a natural-language diagnosis grounded in the same feedback. We introduce APRIL (Automated Proof Repair in Lean), a dataset of 260,000 supervised tuples pairing systematically generated proof failures with compiler diagnostics and aligned repair and explanation targets. Training language models on APRIL substantially improves repair accuracy and feedback-conditioned reasoning; in our single-shot repair evaluation setting, a finetuned 4B-parameter model outperforms the strongest open-source baseline. We view diagnostic-conditioned supervision as a complementary training signal for feedback-using provers.

Existing adaptive strategies based on gradient noise scale (GNS) offer a principled alternative. However, their assumption of SGD's Euclidean geometry creates a fundamental mismatch with popular optimizers based on generalized norms, such as signSGD / Signum ($\\ell_\\infty$) and stochastic spectral descent (specSGD) / Muon ($\\mathcal{S}_\\infty$). In this work, we derive gradient noise scales for signSGD and specSGD that naturally emerge from the geometry of their respective dual norms. To practically estimate these non-Euclidean metrics, we propose an efficient variance estimation procedure that leverages the local mini-batch gradients on different ranks in distributed data-parallel systems. Our experiments demonstrate that adaptive batch size strategies using non-Euclidean GNS enable us to match the validation loss of constant-batch baselines while reducing training steps by up to 66% for Signum and Muon on a 160 million parameter Llama model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08GNS\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6d41\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982signSGD/specSGD\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8303\u6570\u7684GNS\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57281.6\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684Llama\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97GNS\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a\u8fbe66%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08GNS\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u5047\u8bbe\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff08SGD\uff09\u7684\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e7f\u4e49\u8303\u6570\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982signSGD/Signum\u548cspecSGD/Muon\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u786c\u4ef6\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684GNS\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u4e3asignSGD\u548cspecSGD\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u5b83\u4eec\u5404\u81ea\u5bf9\u5076\u8303\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u7b49\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u5b9e\u9645\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eSignum\u548cMuon\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u62e5\u67091.6\u4ebf\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684Llama\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97GNS\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5927\u5c0f\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8fbe66%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u6c34\u5e73\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u7684\u975e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u67d0\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002"}}

As a privacy-preserving framework to leverage decentralized data for collaborative model training, Federated Learning (FL) is gaining popularity in LLM fine-tuning, but remains challenging due to the high cost of transmitting full model parameters and computing full gradients on resource-constrained clients. While Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used in FL to reduce communication and memory costs, they often sacrifice model performance compared to FFT. This paper proposes FedKRSO (Federated $K$-Seed Random Subspace Optimization), a novel method that enables communication and memory efficient FFT of LLMs in federated settings. In FedKRSO, clients update the model within a shared set of random low-dimension subspaces generated by the server to save memory usage. Furthermore, instead of transmitting full model parameters in each FL round, clients send only the model update accumulators along the subspaces to the server, enabling efficient global model aggregation and dissemination. By using these strategies, FedKRSO can substantially reduce communication and memory overhead while overcoming the performance limitations of PEFT, closely approximating the performance of federated FFT. The convergence properties of FedKRSO are analyzed rigorously under general FL settings.

In this work, we introduce the Consistency Deep Equilibrium Model (C-DEQ), a novel framework that leverages consistency distillation to accelerate DEQ inference. We cast the DEQ iterative inference process as evolution along a fixed ODE trajectory toward the equilibrium. Along this trajectory, we train C-DEQs to consistently map intermediate states directly to the fixed point, enabling few-step inference while preserving the performance of the teacher DEQ. At the same time, it facilitates multi-step evaluation to flexibly trade computation for performance gains.

To address these limitations, we propose CoBA-RL, a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to adaptively allocate rollout budgets based on the model's evolving capability. Specifically, CoBA-RL utilizes a Capability-Oriented Value function to map tasks to their potential training gains and employs a heap-based greedy strategy to efficiently self-calibrate the distribution of computational resources to samples with high training value.

Practical solvers for these problems typically follow a predictor-corrector (PC) structure, but rely on hand-crafted heuristics for step sizes and iteration termination, which are often suboptimal and task-specific. To address this, we unify these problems under a single framework, which enables the design of a general neural solver. Building on this unified view, we propose Neural Predictor-Corrector (NPC), which replaces hand-crafted heuristics with automatically learned policies. NPC formulates policy selection as a sequential decision-making problem and leverages reinforcement learning to automatically discover efficient strategies. To further enhance generalization, we introduce an amortized training mechanism, enabling one-time offline training for a class of problems and efficient online inference on new instances. Experiments on four representative homotopy problems demonstrate that our method generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

We introduce TextME, the first text-only modality expansion framework, to the best of our knowledge, projecting diverse modalities into LLM embedding space as a unified anchor. Our approach exploits the geometric structure of pretrained contrastive encoders to enable zero-shot cross-modal transfer using only text descriptions, without paired supervision. We empirically validate that such consistent modality gaps exist across image, video, audio, 3D, X-ray, and molecular domains, demonstrating that text-only training can preserve substantial performance of pretrained encoders. We further show that our framework enables emergent cross-modal retrieval between modality pairs not explicitly aligned during training (e.g., audio-to-image, 3D-to-image).

Under ideal conditions, we show that the objective function of C-GRPO is directionally aligned with the gradient of the expected-utility objective underlying MBR decoding, leading to a convergence guarantee.

A central challenge in BDL lies in the design of informative prior distributions that scale effectively to high-dimensional data. Recent functional variational inference (VI) approaches address this issue by imposing priors directly in function space; however, most existing methods rely on Gaussian process (GP) priors, whose expressiveness and generalisation capabilities become limited in high-dimensional regimes. In this work, we propose VLM-FS-EB, a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework, leveraging large vision-language models (VLMs) to generates semantically meaningful context points. These synthetic samples are then used VLMs for embeddings to construct expressive functional priors. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various baselines, and experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves predictive performance and yields more reliable uncertainty estimates, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks and data-scarce regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6VLM-FS-EB\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLM-FS-EB\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u968f\u540e\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "VLM-FS-EB\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u529f\u80fd\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Standard fine-tuning paradigms, including Reinforcement Learning (RL), fundamentally rely on backpropagation and high-precision weights to compute gradients. Thus they cannot be used on quantized models, where the parameter space is discrete and non-differentiable. While Evolution Strategies (ES) offer a backpropagation-free alternative, optimization of the quantized parameters can still fail due to vanishing or inaccurate gradient. This paper introduces Quantized Evolution Strategies (QES), an optimization paradigm that performs full-parameter fine-tuning directly in the quantized space. QES is based on two innovations: (1) it integrates accumulated error feedback to preserve high-precision gradient signals, and (2) it utilizes a stateless seed replay to reduce memory usage to low-precision inference levels. QES significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art zeroth-order fine-tuning method on arithmetic reasoning tasks, making direct fine-tuning for quantized models possible.

Despite intense recent research on the topic and promising results, how can the LLM internal representation of the space of possible programs be maximally exploited to improve performance is an open question. Here, we introduce Contrastive Concept-Tree Search (CCTS), which extracts a hierarchical concept representation from the generated programs and learns a contrastive concept model that guides parent selection. By reweighting parents using a likelihood-ratio score between high- and low-performing solutions, CCTS biases search toward useful concept combinations and away from misleading ones, providing guidance through an explicit concept hierarchy rather than the algorithm lineage constructed by the LLM. We show that CCTS improves search efficiency over fitness-based baselines and produces interpretable, task-specific concept trees across a benchmark of open Erd\u0151s-type combinatorics problems. Our analysis indicates that the gains are driven largely by learning which concepts to avoid.

Leveraging this, we introduce SATORIS-N, a framework for imputing partially observed traffic-density by informed subspace priors from neighboring days. Our contribution is a subspace-aware semidefinite programming (SDP)} formulation of nuclear norm that explicitly informs the reconstruction with prior singular-subspace information. This convex formulation jointly enforces low rank and subspace alignment, providing a single global optimum and substantially improving accuracy under medium and high occlusion. We also study a lightweight implicit subspace-alignment} strategy in which matrices from consecutive days are concatenated to encourage alignment of spatial or temporal singular directions. Although this heuristic offers modest gains when missing rates are low, the explicit SDP approach is markedly more robust when large fractions of entries are missing. Across two real-world datasets (Beijing and Shanghai), SATORIS-N consistently outperforms standard matrix-completion methods such as SoftImpute, IterativeSVD, statistical, and even deep learning baselines at high occlusion levels.

However, under sparse terminal rewards, GRPO often stalls because rollouts within a group frequently receive identical rewards, causing relative advantages to collapse and updates to vanish. We propose self-hint aligned GRPO with privileged supervision (SAGE), an on-policy reinforcement learning framework that injects privileged hints during training to reshape the rollout distribution under the same terminal verifier reward. For each prompt $x$, the model samples a compact hint $h$ (e.g., a plan or decomposition) and then generates a solution $\u03c4$ conditioned on $(x,h)$. Crucially, the task reward $R(x,\u03c4)$ is unchanged; hints only increase within-group outcome diversity under finite sampling, preventing GRPO advantages from collapsing under sparse rewards. At test time, we set $h=\\varnothing$ and deploy the no-hint policy without any privileged information. Moreover, sampling diverse self-hints serves as an adaptive curriculum that tracks the learner's bottlenecks more effectively than fixed hints from an initial policy or a stronger external model. Experiments over 6 benchmarks with 3 LLMs show that SAGE consistently outperforms GRPO, on average +2.0 on Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, +1.2 on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and +1.3 on Qwen3-4B-Instruct.

In this work, we propose MemCast, a learning-to-memory framework that reformulates TSF as an experience-conditioned reasoning task. Specifically, we learn experience from the training set and organize it into a hierarchical memory. This is achieved by summarizing prediction results into historical patterns, distilling inference trajectories into reasoning wisdom, and inducing extracted temporal features into general laws. Furthermore, during inference, we leverage historical patterns to guide the reasoning process and utilize reasoning wisdom to select better trajectories, while general laws serve as criteria for reflective iteration. Additionally, to enable continual evolution, we design a dynamic confidence adaptation strategy that updates the confidence of individual entries without leaking the test set distribution. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that MemCast consistently outperforms previous methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

This paper introduces the Psychological Regret Model (PRM), a novel approach that accelerates learning by incorporating regret-based feedback signals after each decision step. Rather than waiting for terminal rewards, PRM computes a regret signal based on the difference between the expected value of the optimal action and the value of the action taken in each state. This transforms sparse rewards into dense feedback signals through a step-wise scoring framework, enabling faster convergence. We demonstrate that PRM achieves stable performance approximately 36\\% faster than traditional Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in benchmark environments such as Lunar Lander. Our results indicate that PRM is particularly effective in continuous control tasks and environments with delayed feedback, making it suitable for real-world applications such as robotics, finance, and adaptive education where rapid policy adaptation is critical.

In this paper we tackle the generality problem head-on, by aiming to develop a unified model for all tasks embedded in a task-space.

As the space of tasks is large, experimental exploration of the entire space is infeasible. To solve this problem we propose the adversarial construction approach, which helps identify tasks that are most likely to elicit a qualitatively novel behavior.

Current compression methods rely on rigid splitting strategies, such as fixed intervals or pre-defined delimiters. We observe that rigid splitting suffers from significant accuracy degradation (ranging from 5.5% to 55.1%) across different scenarios, owing to the scenario-dependent nature of the semantic boundaries. This highlights the necessity of dynamic semantic splitting to match semantics. To achieve this, we face two challenges. (1) Improper delimiter selection misaligns semantics with the KVCache, resulting in 28.6% accuracy loss. (2) Variable-length blocks after splitting introduce over 73.1% additional inference overhead. To address the above challenges, we propose DynSplit-KV, a KVCache compression method that dynamically identifies delimiters for splitting. We propose: (1) a dynamic importance-aware delimiter selection strategy, improving accuracy by 49.9%. (2) A uniform mapping strategy that transforms variable-length semantic blocks into a fixed-length format, reducing inference overhead by 4.9x.

However, prior work has consistently observed an entropy collapse phenomenon during reinforcement post-training, characterized by a monotonic decrease in policy entropy that ultimately leads to training instability and collapse. As a result, most existing approaches restrict training to short horizons (typically 5-20 epochs), limiting sustained exploration and hindering further policy improvement. In addition, nearly all prior work relies on a single, fixed reasoning prompt or template during training. In this work, we introduce prompt augmentation, a training strategy that instructs the model to generate reasoning traces under diverse templates and formats, thereby increasing rollout diversity. We show that, without a KL regularization term, prompt augmentation enables stable scaling of training duration under a fixed dataset and allows the model to tolerate low-entropy regimes without premature collapse. Empirically, a Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B model trained with prompt augmentation on the MATH Level 3-5 dataset achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 44.5 per-benchmark accuracy and 51.3 per-question accuracy on standard mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME24, AMC, MATH500, Minerva, and OlympiadBench.

Standard approaches treat the LLM as the policy and apply RL directly over the full vocabulary space. However, this formulation includes the massive tail of contextually irrelevant tokens in the action space, which could distract the policy from focusing on decision-making among the truly reasonable tokens. In this work, we verify that valid reasoning paths could inherently concentrate within a low-rank subspace. Based on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens (RLPT), a framework that mitigates the action space issue by decoupling strategic decision-making from token generation. Specifically, RLPT leverages the semantic priors of the base model to identify a dynamic set of \\emph{promising tokens} and constrains policy optimization exclusively to this refined subset via masking. Theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrate that RLPT effectively reduces gradient variance, stabilizes the training process, and improves sample efficiency. Experiment results on math, coding, and telecom reasoning show that RLPT outperforms standard RL baselines and integrates effectively across various model sizes (4B and 8B) and RL algorithms (GRPO and DAPO).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6RLPT\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u7ec4\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u4ec5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fc7\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRLPT\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\uff0c\u5e72\u6270\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u5408\u7406\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aRLPT\uff08Reinforcement Learning with Promising Tokens\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u4e00\u7ec4\u2018\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u2019\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8fd9\u7ec4\u7cbe\u9009\u8bcd\u6c47\u4e4b\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cRLPT\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7a0b\u4ee5\u53ca\u7535\u4fe1\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRLPT\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRL\u57fa\u51c6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b83\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u598240\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u548c80\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u79cdRL\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ecGRPO\u548cDAPO\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528RLPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Work in progress", "summary": "Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) achieves high sample efficiency by simulating future trajectories with learned dynamics and reward models. However, its effectiveness is severely compromised in sparse reward settings. The core limitation lies in the standard paradigm of regressing ground-truth scalar rewards: in sparse environments, this yields a flat, gradient-free landscape that fails to provide directional guidance for planning. To address this challenge, we propose Shaping Landscapes with Optimistic Potential Estimates (SLOPE), a novel framework that shifts reward modeling from predicting scalars to constructing informative potential landscapes. SLOPE employs optimistic distributional regression to estimate high-confidence upper bounds, which amplifies rare success signals and ensures sufficient exploration gradients. Evaluations on 30+ tasks across 5 benchmarks demonstrate that SLOPE consistently outperforms leading baselines in fully sparse, semi-sparse, and dense rewards.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6SLOPE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u6f5c\u529b\u666f\u89c2\u800c\u975e\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MBRL\uff09\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u800c\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd9\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SLOPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u4e50\u89c2\u5206\u5e03\u56de\u5f52\u4f30\u8ba1\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u653e\u5927\u7f55\u89c1\u6210\u529f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u6784\u9020\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u666f\u89c2\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u56de\u5f52\u771f\u5b9e\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf95\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u768430\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u534a\u7a00\u758f\u8fd8\u662f\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cSLOPE\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u9886\u5148\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SLOPE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches that optimize the high-dimensional initial noise suffer from severe inefficiency, as many search directions exert negligible influence on the final generation.

Building on this insight, we propose Spectral Evolution Search (SES), a plug-and-play framework for initial noise optimization that executes gradient-free evolutionary search within a low-frequency subspace.

This paper studies a test-time scaling method that enables sampling from regions with higher human-aligned reward values. Existing gradient guidance methods approximate the expected future reward (EFR) at an intermediate particle $\\mathbf{x}_t$ using a Taylor approximation, but this approximation at each time step incurs high computational cost due to sequential neural backpropagation. We show that the EFR at any $\\mathbf{x}_t$ can be computed using only marginal samples from a pre-trained diffusion model. The proposed EFR formulation detaches the neural dependency between $\\mathbf{x}_t$ and the EFR, enabling closed-form guidance computation without neural backpropagation. To further improve efficiency, we introduce lookahead sampling to collect marginal samples. For final sample generation, we use an accurate solver that guides particles toward high-reward lookahead samples. We refer to this sampling scheme as LiDAR sampling. LiDAR achieves substantial performance improvements using only three samples with a 3-step lookahead solver, exhibiting steep performance gains as lookahead accuracy and sample count increase; notably, it reaches the same GenEval performance as the latest gradient guidance method for SDXL with a 9.5x speedup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLiDAR\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97EFR\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528lookahead\u91c7\u6837\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4ece\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503c\u7684\u533a\u57df\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u9996\u5148\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u95f4\u7c92\u5b50$\\mathbf{x}_t$\u5904\u7684\u671f\u671b\u672a\u6765\u56de\u62a5\uff08EFR\uff09\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4ec5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6837\u672c\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97EFR\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86lookahead\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7c92\u5b50\u671d\u5411\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7684lookahead\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u914d\u54083\u6b65\u524d\u77bb\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0cLiDAR\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u524d\u77bb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5728SDXL\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u65b0\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684GenEval\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u901f9.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LiDAR\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5927\u5e45\u52a0\u901f\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

We introduce a hierarchical self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that jointly learns node-, edge-, and graph-level embeddings, inspired by multimodal neuroimaging. We construct a controllable synthetic benchmark mimicking the topological properties of connectomes. Our four-stage evaluation protocol reveals a critical failure: the invariance-based SSL model is fundamentally misaligned with the benchmark's topological properties and is catastrophically outperformed by classical, topology-aware heuristics. Ablations confirm an objective mismatch: SSL objectives designed to be invariant to topological perturbations learn to ignore the very community structure that classical methods exploit. Our results expose a fundamental pitfall in applying generic graph SSL to connectome-like data. We present this framework as a cautionary case study, highlighting the need for new, topology-aware SSL objectives for neuro-AI research that explicitly reward the preservation of structure (e.g., modularity or motifs).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60(SSL)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6a21\u4eff\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u6210\u50cf\u6765\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u3001\u8fb9\u548c\u56fe\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684SSL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u88ab\u7ecf\u5178\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5e45\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u56feSSL\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u9677\u9631\uff0c\u5e76\u547c\u5401\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684SSL\u76ee\u6807\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u795e\u7ecfAI\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u5168\u5c40\u5927\u8111\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SSL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u62d3\u6251\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5982\u5927\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u795e\u7ecf\u6210\u50cf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u8282\u70b9\u7ea7\u3001\u8fb9\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u56fe\u8c31\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u654f\u611f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684SSL\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\u81f3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u3001\u8003\u8651\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u62b5\u6297\u62d3\u6251\u6270\u52a8\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7684SSL\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u793e\u533a\u7ed3\u6784\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e94\u7528\u901a\u7528\u56feSSL\u5230\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5927\u8111\u8fde\u63a5\u7ec4\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66AI\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6216\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5SSL\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Model merging has gained prominence for its efficiency and controllability. However, existing merging techniques typically serve as post-hoc refinements or focus on mitigating task interference, often failing to capture the dynamic optimization benefits of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In this work, we propose Streaming Merging, an innovative model updating paradigm that conceptualizes merging as an iterative optimization process. Central to this paradigm is \\textbf{ARM} (\\textbf{A}ctivation-guided \\textbf{R}otation-aware \\textbf{M}erging), a strategy designed to approximate gradient descent dynamics. By treating merging coefficients as learning rates and deriving rotation vectors from activation subspaces, ARM effectively steers parameter updates along data-driven trajectories. Unlike conventional linear interpolation, ARM aligns semantic subspaces to preserve the geometric structure of high-dimensional parameter evolution. Remarkably, ARM requires only early SFT checkpoints and, through iterative merging, surpasses the fully converged SFT model. Experimental results across model scales (1.7B to 14B) and diverse domains (e.g., math, code) demonstrate that ARM can transcend converged checkpoints. Extensive experiments show that ARM provides a scalable and lightweight framework for efficient model adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aARM\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5408\u5e76\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bfc\u51fa\u65cb\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cARM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u655b\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u56e0\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u5f3a\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u91cd\u89c6\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u901a\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8b\u540e\u6539\u8fdb\u6216\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u51cf\u8f7b\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u597d\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u5408\u5e76\uff08Streaming Merging\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5408\u5e76\u89c6\u4f5c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5176\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u662fARM\uff08Activation-guided Rotation-aware Merging\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e8\u5728\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5408\u5e76\u7cfb\u6570\u5f53\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u5bfc\u65cb\u8f6c\u5411\u91cf\uff0cARM\u80fd\u591f\u6cbf\u7740\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cARM\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7ef4\u53c2\u6570\u6f14\u53d8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece1.7B\u523014B\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ARM\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5408\u5e76\u8d85\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u655b\u7684SFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "ARM\u7b56\u7565\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This framework generalizes existed RR-type mechanisms as special cases under specific parameter settings, which eliminates the need for separate, case-by-case analysis. Theoretically, we prove that BlockRR satisfies $\u03b5$-label DP. We also design a partition method for BlockRR based on a weight matrix derived from label prior information; the parallel composition principle ensures that the composition of two such mechanisms remains $\u03b5$-label DP. Empirically, we evaluate BlockRR on two variants of CIFAR-10 with varying degrees of class imbalance. Results show that in the high-privacy and moderate-privacy regimes ($\u03b5\\leq 3.0$), our propsed method gets a better balance between test accuaracy and the average of per-class accuracy. In the low-privacy regime ($\u03b5\\geq 4.0$), all methods reduce BlockRR to standard RR without additional performance loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BlockRR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u968f\u673a\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u03b5-\u6807\u7b7eDP\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff08\u03b5\u22643.0\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u72ec\u5206\u6790\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u968f\u673a\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236BlockRR\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u7ec4\u5408\u539f\u5219\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u673a\u5236\u7ec4\u5408\u540e\u4ecd\u7136\u6ee1\u8db3\u03b5-\u6807\u7b7eDP\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9690\u79c1\uff08\u03b5\u22641.0\uff09\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\uff081.0<\u03b5\u22643.0\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6bcf\u7c7b\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u5f53\u5904\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9690\u79c1\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u03b5\u22654.0\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6RR\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u989d\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "BlockRR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u624b\u6bb5\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6cdb\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u968f\u673a\u54cd\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms rarely perform well across different anomaly types, often excelling only under specific structural assumptions. This lack of robustness also becomes particularly evident under noisy settings. We propose Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE), a fully unsupervised framework that detects anomalies through their geometric response to density-driven manifold evolution. MSDE is based on the principle that normal samples, being well supported by local density, remain stable under iterative density enhancement, whereas anomalous samples undergo large cumulative displacements as they are attracted toward nearby density modes. To operationalize this idea, MSDE employs a weighted mean-shift procedure with adaptive, sample-specific density weights derived from a UMAP-based fuzzy neighborhood graph. Anomaly scores are defined by the total displacement accumulated across a small number of mean-shift iterations. We evaluate MSDE on the ADBench benchmark, comprising forty six real-world tabular datasets, four realistic anomaly generation mechanisms, and six noise levels. Compared to 13 established unsupervised baselines, MSDE achieves consistently strong, balanced and robust performance for AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, and Precision@n, at several noise levels and on average over several types of anomalies. These results demonstrate that displacement-based scoring provides a robust alternative to the existing state-of-the-art for unsupervised anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE)\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bc6\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u6f14\u5316\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f02\u5e38\u3002\u5728ADBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0e13\u4e2a\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMSDE\u5728AUC-ROC\u3001AUC-PR\u548cPrecision@n\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5065\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u4e0d\u540c\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u52a0\u901a\u7528\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Mean Shift Density Enhancement (MSDE)\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7531\u4e8e\u53d7\u5230\u5c40\u90e8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u826f\u597d\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u800c\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u5219\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u88ab\u5438\u5f15\u5230\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u4f4d\u79fb\u3002MSDE\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u52a0\u6743\u5747\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u3001\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u662f\u4eceUMAP\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u3002\u5f02\u5e38\u5f97\u5206\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5747\u503c\u6f02\u79fb\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u7684\u603b\u4f4d\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b46\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u30014\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u548c6\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684ADBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86MSDE\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e13\u79cd\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMSDE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684AUC-ROC\u3001AUC-PR\u548cPrecision@n\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u5747\u8861\u4ee5\u53ca\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bc4\u5206\u7684MSDE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose Collective Adversarial Data Synthesis (CADS), a novel and general approach to synthesize high-quality, diverse and challenging multimodal data for MLLMs. The core idea of CADS is to leverage collective intelligence to ensure high-quality and diverse generation, while exploring adversarial learning to synthesize challenging samples for effectively driving model improvement. Specifically, CADS operates with two cyclic phases, i.e., Collective Adversarial Data Generation (CAD-Generate) and Collective Adversarial Data Judgment (CAD-Judge).

To overcome this limitation, a significant line of research has introduced regularization techniques to ensure stable convergence under function approximation. In this work, we propose a new algorithm, periodic regularized Q-learning (PRQ). We first introduce regularization at the level of the projection operator and explicitly construct a regularized projected value iteration (RP-VI), subsequently extending it to a sample-based RL algorithm. By appropriately regularizing the projection operator, the resulting projected value iteration becomes a contraction.

Byzantine failures. To solve this issue, robust distributed learning algorithms have been developed, which typically replace parameter averaging by robust aggregations. While generic conditions on these aggregations exist to guarantee the convergence of (Stochastic) Gradient Descent (SGD), the analyses remain rather ad-hoc. This hinders the development of more complex robust algorithms, such as accelerated ones. In this work, we show that Byzantine-robust distributed optimization can, under standard generic assumptions, be cast as a general optimization with inexact gradient oracles (with both additive and multiplicative error terms), an active field of research.\n  This allows for instance to directly show that GD on top of standard robust aggregation procedures obtains optimal asymptotic error in the Byzantine setting. Going further, we propose two optimization schemes to speed up the convergence. The first one is a Nesterov-type accelerated scheme whose proof directly derives from accelerated inexact gradient results applied to our formulation. The second one hinges on Optimization under Similarity, in which the server leverages an auxiliary loss function that approximates the global loss. Both approaches allow to drastically reduce the communication complexity compared to previous methods, as we show theoretically and empirically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5e26\u6709\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6oracle\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\u7684Nesterov\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5c40\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4e0a\u90fd\u5927\u5927\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u8282\u70b9\uff08\u5373\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u6545\u969c\uff09\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e00\u4e9b\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4ecd\u7136\u8f83\u4e3a\u968f\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u9c81\u68d2\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u52a0\u901f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u901a\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5c06\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6oracles\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u52a0\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u53d7\u52a0\u901f\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u68af\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u542f\u53d1\u7684Nesterov\u7c7b\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u5219\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u2018\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u2019\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, as models often learn tasks in a similar order, we hypothesize that easier tasks will be easier regardless of how they are presented to the model. Indeed, in this paper, we show that as models approach high performance on a task, robustness is effectively achieved. Through an empirical analysis of multiple models across diverse datasets and configurations (e.g., paraphrases, different temperatures), we find a strong positive correlation. Moreover, we find that robustness is primarily driven by task-specific competence rather than inherent model-level properties, challenging current approaches that treat robustness as an independent capability. Thus, from a high-level perspective, we may expect that as new tasks saturate, model robustness on these tasks will emerge accordingly. For researchers, this implies that explicit efforts to measure and improve robustness may warrant reduced emphasis, as such robustness is likely to develop alongside performance gains. For practitioners, it acts as a sign that indeed the tasks that the literature deals with are unreliable, but on easier past tasks, the models are reliable and ready for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u9ad8\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u81ea\u7136\u800c\u7136\u5730\u5f97\u5230\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e5f\u4f1a\u76f8\u5e94\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u4f5c\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u867d\u7136\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u8ba8\u8bba\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u591f\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8f83\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8fc7\u53bb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u8db3\u591f\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u9c81\u640f\u6027\u7684\u83b7\u5f97\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96be\u6613\u7a0b\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5e76\u5047\u8bbe\u5373\u4f7f\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u5448\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u59cb\u7ec8\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6311\u6218\u5f53\u524d\u5c06\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u540c\u4e49\u53e5\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u6e29\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff1a\u5373\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e5f\u968f\u4e4b\u589e\u5f3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u66f4\u591a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u80dc\u4efb\u529b\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u9010\u6e10\u8fbe\u5230\u9971\u548c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e5f\u4f1a\u81ea\u7136\u5f62\u6210\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8fc7\u5206\u5f3a\u8c03\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5219\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u51c6\u5907\u597d\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This insight enables a direct test for potential causal relationships by checking the variance of their corresponding effect-cause conditional distributions across multiple downsampled subsets of the data. These subsets are selected to reflect different prior cause distributions, while preserving the effect-cause conditional relationships. Using this invariance test and exploiting an (empirical) sparsity of most causal graphs, we develop an algorithm that efficiently uncovers causal relationships with quadratic complexity in the number of observational variables, reducing the processing time by up to 25x compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However, these strategies are impractical for edge device deployment due to limited RAM and NPU resources. Despite hardware constraints, deploying performant LLM on edge devices such as smartphone remains crucial for user experience. To address this, we propose MeKi (Memory-based Expert Knowledge Injection), a novel system that scales LLM capacity via storage space rather than FLOPs. MeKi equips each Transformer layer with token-level memory experts that injects pre-stored semantic knowledge into the generation process. To bridge the gap between training capacity and inference efficiency, we employ a re-parameterization strategy to fold parameter matrices used during training into a compact static lookup table. By offloading the knowledge to ROM, MeKi decouples model capacity from computational cost, introducing zero inference latency overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeKi significantly outperforms dense LLM baselines with identical inference speed, validating the effectiveness of memory-based scaling paradigm for on-device LLMs. Project homepage is at https://github.com/ningding-o/MeKi.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMeKi\u7684\u65b0\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u800c\u975e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7684RAM\u548cNPU\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7528\u6237\u826f\u597d\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81f3\u5982\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u7b49\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MeKi\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "MeKi\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2aTransformer\u5c42\u914d\u5907\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u5b58\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u91cd\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u6298\u53e0\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9759\u6001\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230ROM\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8131\u94a9\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\uff0cMeKi\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bLLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684LLM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86MeKi\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u9ad8\u6548\u80fd\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the phenomenon of benign relearning, in which forgotten information reemerges even from benign fine-tuning data, reveals that existing unlearning methods remain fundamentally fragile. A common explanation attributes this effect to topical relevance, but we find this account insufficient. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate that syntactic similarity, rather than topicality, is the primary driver: across benchmarks, syntactically similar data consistently trigger recovery even without topical overlap, due to their alignment in representations and gradients with the forgotten content. Motivated by this insight, we introduce syntactic diversification, which paraphrases the original forget queries into heterogeneous structures prior to unlearning. This approach effectively suppresses benign relearning, accelerates forgetting, and substantially alleviates the trade-off between unlearning efficacy and model utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u4fe1\u606f\u540e\u91cd\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u53e5\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53e5\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u826f\u6027\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u518d\u6b21\u6d6e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u826f\u6027\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u539f\u56e0\u5f52\u7ed3\u4e8e\u8bdd\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u53e5\u6cd5\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5171\u540c\u4e3b\u9898\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53e5\u6cd5\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u89e6\u53d1\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6062\u590d\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u2018\u53e5\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u2019\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6267\u884c\u9057\u5fd8\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u524d\u5148\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u9057\u5fd8\u8bf7\u6c42\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53e5\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u826f\u6027\u91cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0c\u52a0\u5feb\u9057\u5fd8\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u5e45\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53e5\u6cd5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5f7b\u5e95\u5730\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u5730\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u96be\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While recent studies increasingly focus on monitoring and adjusting entropy to better balance exploration and exploitation in reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a principled understanding of entropy dynamics during this process is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the entropy dynamics during the RFT process, which begins with a discriminant expression that quantifies entropy change under a single logit update. This foundation enables the derivation of a first-order expression for entropy change, which can be further extended to the update formula of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). The corollaries and insights drawn from the theoretical analysis inspire the design of entropy control methods, and also offer a unified lens for interpreting various entropy-based methods in existing studies. We provide empirical evidence to support the main conclusions of our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived entropy-discriminator clipping methods. This study yields novel insights into RFT training dynamics, providing theoretical support and practical strategies for optimizing the exploration-exploitation balance during LLM fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u71b5\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u5173\u6ce8\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u8c03\u6574\u71b5\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e73\u8861\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RFT\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u6709\u5f85\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790RFT\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u4e2alogit\u66f4\u65b0\u4e0b\u7684\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u5224\u522b\u8868\u8fbe\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u516c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u71b5-\u5224\u522b\u5668\u88c1\u526a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b49\u71b5\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3RFT\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u5b9e\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Prior work shows RLVR works with few prompts, but prompt selection is often based only on training-accuracy variance, leading to unstable optimization directions and weaker transfer. We revisit prompt selection from a mechanism-level view and argue that an effective minibatch should provide both (i) a reliable positive anchor and (ii) explicit negative learning signals from rare failures. Based on this principle, we propose \\emph{positive--negative pairing}: at each update, we sample a hard-but-solvable $q^{+}$ and an easy-but-brittle prompt $q^{-}$(high success rate but not perfect), characterized by low and high empirical success rates under multiple rollouts. We further introduce Weighted GRPO, which reweights binary outcomes at the pair level and uses group-normalized advantages to amplify rare successes on $q^{+}$ into sharp positive guidance while turning rare failures on $q^{-}$ into strong negative penalties. This bidirectional signal provides informative learning feedback for both successes and failures, improving sample efficiency without suppressing exploration. On Qwen2.5-Math-7B, a single paired minibatch per update consistently outperforms a GRPO baseline that selects two prompts via commonly used variance-based selection heuristics: AIME~2025 Pass@8 improves from 16.8 to 22.2, and AMC23 Pass@64 from 94.0 to 97.0, while remaining competitive with large-scale RLVR trained from a pool of 1209 training prompts.

Yet existing constructive layers that project predictions onto constraint boundaries face a fundamental bottleneck: gradient saturation. By collapsing exterior points onto lower-dimensional surfaces, standard orthogonal projections induce rank-deficient Jacobians, which nullify gradients orthogonal to active constraints and hinder optimization. We introduce Soft-Radial Projection, a differentiable reparameterization layer that circumvents this issue through a radial mapping from Euclidean space into the interior of the feasible set. This construction guarantees strict feasibility while preserving a full-rank Jacobian almost everywhere, thereby preventing the optimization stalls typical of boundary-based methods.

To address this, we propose scDiVa, a masked discrete diffusion foundation model that aligns generation with the dropout-like corruption process by defining a continuous-time forward masking mechanism in token space. ScDiVa features a bidirectional denoiser that jointly models discrete gene identities and continuous values, utilizing entropy-normalized serialization and a latent anchor token to maximize information efficiency and preserve global cell identity. The model is trained via depth-invariant time sampling and a dual denoising objective to simulate varying sparsity levels while ensuring precise recovery of both identity and magnitude. Pre-trained on 59 million cells, scDiVa achieves strong transfer performance across major benchmarks, including batch integration, cell type annotation, and perturbation response prediction.

However, they face a fundamental challenge in balancing task-specific performance gains against catastrophic forgetting of pre-trained knowledge, where existing methods provide inconsistent recommendations. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the performance-forgetting trade-offs inherent in low-rank adaptation using principal components as initialization. Our investigation reveals that fine-tuning intermediate components leads to better balance and show more robustness to high learning rates than first (PiSSA) and last (MiLoRA) components in existing work. Building on these findings, we provide a practical approach for initialization of LoRA that offers superior trade-offs.

However, prior RPG approaches have been predominantly restricted to Gaussian policies, limiting their performance and failing to leverage recent advances in generative models. In this work, we identify that flow policies, which generate actions via differentiable ODE integration, naturally align with the RPG framework, a connection not established in prior work. However, naively exploiting this synergy proves ineffective, often suffering from training instability and a lack of exploration. We propose Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO). RFO computes policy gradients by backpropagating jointly through the flow generation process and system dynamics, unlocking high sample efficiency without requiring intractable log-likelihood calculations. RFO includes two tailored regularization terms for stability and exploration. We also propose a variant of RFO with action chunking. Extensive experiments on diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks, involving both rigid and soft bodies with state or visual inputs, demonstrate the effectiveness of RFO. Notably, on a challenging locomotion task controlling a soft-body quadruped, RFO achieves almost $2\\times$ the reward of the state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u5171\u540c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u8f6f\u4f53\u56db\u8db3\u52a8\u7269\u65f6\uff0cRFO\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u51e0\u4e4e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Reparameterization Policy Gradient (RPG) \u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206ODE\u79ef\u5206\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u4e0eRPG\u6846\u67b6\u81ea\u7136\u5951\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u534f\u540c\u6548\u5e94\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Reparameterization Flow Policy Optimization (RFO)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002RFO\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65e5\u5fd7\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9879\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5757\u6280\u672f\u7684RFO\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u521a\u6027\u548c\u8f6f\u4f53\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ee5\u53ca\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8f6f\u4f53\u56db\u8db3\u52a8\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cRFO\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e24\u500d\u7684\u56de\u62a5\u3002", "conclusion": "RFO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Although mechanistic interpretability has successfully identified circuits in language and vision models, it has not yet been applied to SR. In this article, we introduce PATCHES, an evolutionary circuit discovery algorithm that identifies compact and correct circuits for SR. Using PATCHES, we isolate 28 circuits, providing the first circuit-level characterisation of an SR transformer. We validate these findings through a robust causal evaluation framework based on key notions such as faithfulness, completeness, and minimality. Our analysis shows that mean patching with performance-based evaluation most reliably isolates functionally correct circuits. In contrast, we demonstrate that direct logit attribution and probing classifiers primarily capture correlational features rather than causal ones, limiting their utility for circuit discovery. Overall, these results establish SR as a high-potential application domain for mechanistic interpretability and propose a principled methodology for circuit discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPATCHES\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7535\u8def\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6b63\u786e\u7535\u8def\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u9886\u57df\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u56de\u5f52\uff08SR\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\u7b26\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u4e3a\u4eba\u6240\u719f\u77e5\u3002\u867d\u7136\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSR\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u7d22SR\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fdb\u5316\u7535\u8def\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5PATCHES\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522bSR\u4e2d\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u4e14\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5229\u7528PATCHES\u9694\u79bb\u51fa\u4e8628\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3001\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6982\u5ff5\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u4fee\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u529f\u80fd\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7535\u8def\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u903b\u8f91\u5c5e\u6027\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u63a2\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\u800c\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7535\u8def\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86SR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u68b0\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u7535\u8def\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u3002"}}

However, it faces severe risks arising from sparse, coordinated malicious behaviors among multiple participants, which are often concealed within normal activities and challenging to detect timely and accurately. In this work, we provide a pioneering study on risk assessment in live streaming rooms, characterized by weak supervision where only room-level labels are available. We formulate the task as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem, treating each room as a bag and defining structured user-timeslot capsules as instances. These capsules represent subsequences of user actions within specific time windows, encapsulating localized behavioral patterns. Based on this formulation, we propose AC-MIL, an Action-aware Capsule MIL framework that models both individual behaviors and group-level coordination patterns. AC-MIL captures multi-granular semantics and behavioral cues through a serial and parallel architecture that jointly encodes temporal dynamics and cross-user dependencies. These signals are integrated for robust room-level risk prediction, while also offering interpretable evidence at the behavior segment level. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets from Douyin demonstrate that AC-MIL significantly outperforms MIL and sequential baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in room-level risk assessment for live streaming.

This enables a single checkpoint to cover a wide range of memory and latency budgets, but renders quantization much more challenging. In particular, the initial MatQuant relies on expensive quantization-aware training (QAT) variants, rather than fast one-shot post training quantization (PTQ), and lacks open-source and kernel support. We address all of these limitations by introducing Post-Training Matryoshka Quantization (MatGPTQ), a new PTQ pipeline that produces a single parent model jointly optimized for multiple target precisions in one-shot, based on a small calibration set. MatGPTQ casts Matryoshka quantization as a multi-precision objective with bit-slicing and cross-bit error compensation, resulting in an algorithm that produces a multi-bit-width, \"sliceable\" model in a single pass. We also incorporate a new budget-aware search for heterogeneous per-layer bit-witdhs and provide efficient kernels that implement slicing and mixed-precision execution. Across standard LLMs and benchmarks, MatGPTQ preserves high-bit accuracy while substantially improving performance at low-bit-witdh settings. Overall, we establish a new state of the art for Matryoshka-style post-training quantization and make single-checkpoint, multi-precision deployment open and practical.

However, objective evaluation of retrosynthesis performance remains limited. Existing benchmarks and metrics typically rely on published synthetic procedures and Top-K accuracy based on single ground-truth, which does not capture the open-ended nature of real-world synthesis planning. We propose a new benchmarking framework for single-step retrosynthesis that evaluates both general-purpose and chemistry-specialized LLMs using ChemCensor, a novel metric for chemical plausibility. By emphasizing plausibility over exact match, this approach better aligns with human synthesis planning practices.

Existing approaches typically rely on either autoregressive large language models (LLMs) for semantic context modeling or diffusion-like models for continuous probabilistic generation. However, neither method alone can adequately model both aspects simultaneously. In this work, we propose CoGenCast, a hybrid generative framework that couples pre-trained LLMs with flow-matching mechanism for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we reconfigure pre-trained decoder-only LLMs into a native forecasting encoder-decoder backbone by modifying only the attention topology, enabling bidirectional context encoding and causal representation generation. Building on this, a flow-matching mechanism is further integrated to model temporal evolution, capturing continuous stochastic dynamics conditioned on the autoregressively generated representation. Notably, CoGenCast naturally supports multimodal forecasting and cross-domain unified training. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that CoGenCast consistently outperforms previous compared baselines.

Some existing approaches propose unlearning verification methods based on backdooring techniques. However, these methods typically require participation in the model's initial training phase to backdoor the model for later verification, which is inefficient and impractical. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification of erasure method (EVE) for verifying machine unlearning without requiring involvement in the model's initial training process. The core idea is to perturb the unlearning data to ensure the model prediction of the specified samples will change before and after unlearning with perturbed data. The unlearning users can leverage the observation of the changes as a verification signal. Specifically, the perturbations are designed with two key objectives: ensuring the unlearning effect and altering the unlearned model's prediction of target samples. We formalize the perturbation generation as an adversarial optimization problem, solving it by aligning the unlearning gradient with the gradient of boundary change for target samples. We conducted extensive experiments, and the results show that EVE can verify machine unlearning without involving the model's initial training process, unlike backdoor-based methods.

Existing symmetric frameworks often suffer from information allocation ambiguity, where the absence of structural inductive bias leads to semantic-specific leakage across modalities. We propose Asymmetric Hierarchical Anchoring (AHA), which enforces directional information allocation by designating a structured semantic anchor within a shared hierarchy. In our instantiation, we exploit the hierarchical discrete representations induced by audio Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) to guide video feature distillation into a shared semantic space. To ensure representational purity, we replace fragile mutual information estimators with a GRL-based adversarial decoupler that explicitly suppresses semantic leakage in modality-specific branches, and introduce Local Sliding Alignment (LSA) to encourage fine-grained temporal alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on AVE and AVVP benchmarks demonstrate that AHA consistently outperforms symmetric baselines in cross-modal transfer. Additional analyses on talking-face disentanglement experiment further validate that the learned representations exhibit improved semantic consistency and disentanglement, indicating the broader applicability of the proposed framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5c42\u951a\u5b9a\uff08AHA\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eGRL\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u8026\u5668\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u6f0f\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAHA\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u65f6\uff0c\u5e38\u9047\u5230\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u7cca\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5c42\u951a\u5b9a\uff08AHA\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5b9a\u5171\u4eab\u5c42\u6b21\u5185\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "AHA\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7531\u97f3\u9891\u6b8b\u4f59\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff08RVQ\uff09\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u70bc\u81f3\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u8f6c\u5c42\uff08GRL\uff09\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u89e3\u8026\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u6291\u5236\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u5206\u652f\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6ed1\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08LSA\uff09\u6280\u672f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86AHA\u5728AVE\u548cAVVP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u79f0\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u8bf4\u8bdd\u4eba\u8138\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u7684\u989d\u5916\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u5206\u5c42\u951a\u5b9a\uff08AHA\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u7f20\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We revisit inverse design through two canonical solutions, the optimal design point and the optimal design distribution, and relate them to optimization and guided generation. Building on this view, we propose a new training loss for cost predictors and a density-gradient optimization method that improves objectives while preserving plausible shapes. We further unify existing training-free guided generation methods. To address their inability to approximate conditional covariance in high dimensions, we develop a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for approximate covariance estimation. Experiments on a controlled 2D study and high-fidelity 3D aerodynamic benchmarks (car and aircraft), validated by OpenFOAM simulations and miniature wind-tunnel tests with 3D-printed prototypes, demonstrate consistent gains in both optimization and guided generation.

In this work, we focus on the problem of how CFs expand the attack surface of MLaaS by strengthening membership inference attacks (MIAs), and on the need to design defense mechanisms that mitigate this emerging risk without undermining utility and explainability. First, we systematically analyze how exposing CFs through query-based APIs enables more effective shadow-based MIAs. Second, we propose a defense framework that integrates Differential Privacy (DP) with Active Learning (AL) to jointly reduce memorization and limit effective training data exposure. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation to characterize the three-way trade-off between privacy leakage, predictive performance, and explanation quality. Our findings highlight the need to carefully balance transparency, utility, and privacy in the responsible deployment of explainable MLaaS systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CFs\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\uff08MIAs\uff09\u6765\u6269\u5927MLaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u9762\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e09\u96be\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5373\u670d\u52a1(MLaaS)\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4e5f\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22CFs\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8fd9\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u53c8\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684API\u66b4\u9732CFs\u5982\u4f55\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u7684MIAs\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1(DP)\u4e0e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60(AL)\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5171\u540c\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5e76\u9650\u5236\u6709\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u66b4\u9732\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u65b9\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u5174\u98ce\u9669\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u524a\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u53ef\u89e3\u91caMLaaS\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u5e73\u8861\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002"}}

However, they still face significant limitations, such as high sampling costs and insufficient physical consistency, stemming from their many-step iterative sampling mechanism and lack of explicit physics constraints. To address these issues, we propose Phys-Instruct, a novel physics-guided distillation framework which not only (1) compresses a pre-trained diffusion PDE solver into a few-step generator via matching generator and prior diffusion distributions to enable rapid sampling, but also (2) enhances the physics consistency by explicitly injecting PDE knowledge through a PDE distillation guidance. Physic-Instruct is built upon a solid theoretical foundation, leading to a practical physics-constrained training objective that admits tractable gradients. Across five PDE benchmarks, Phys-Instruct achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference while reducing PDE error by more than 8 times compared to state-of-the-art diffusion baselines.

However, most generative models either overlook minority groups or fail to produce samples that are useful for downstream learning. We introduce CTTVAE, a Conditional Transformer-based Tabular Variational Autoencoder equipped with two complementary mechanisms: (i) a class-aware triplet margin loss that restructures the latent space for sharper intra-class compactness and inter-class separation, and (ii) a training-by-sampling strategy that adaptively increases exposure to underrepresented groups. Together, these components form CTTVAE+TBS, a framework that consistently yields more representative and utility-aligned samples without destabilizing training. Across six real-world benchmarks, CTTVAE+TBS achieves the strongest downstream utility on minority classes, often surpassing models trained on the original imbalanced data while maintaining competitive fidelity and bridging the gap for privacy for interpolation-based sampling methods and deep generative methods. Ablation studies further confirm that both latent structuring and targeted sampling contribute to these gains. By explicitly prioritizing downstream performance in rare categories, CTTVAE+TBS provides a robust and interpretable solution for conditional tabular data generation, with direct applicability to industries such as healthcare, fraud detection, and predictive maintenance where even small gains in minority cases can be critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCTTVAE\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8fb9\u7f18\u635f\u5931\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5927\u591a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u7528\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CTTVAE\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8868\u683c\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8fb9\u7f18\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u540c\u7c7b\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u5206\u79bb\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCTTVAE+TBS\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u6700\u5f3a\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u63d2\u503c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6f5c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u6837\u90fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u8868\u73b0\uff0cCTTVAE+TBS\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u3001\u6b3a\u8bc8\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ef4\u62a4\u7b49\u884c\u4e1a\u5177\u6709\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u6539\u8fdb\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5173\u952e\u6027\u7684\u3002"}}

Codes are released at https://github.com/zyc140345/HARR", "summary": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to produce evidence-based responses, and its performance hinges on the matching between the retriever and LLMs. Retriever optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning LLMs. However, existing solutions suffer from objective mismatch between retriever optimization and the goal of RAG pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising solution to address this limitation, yet applying RL to retriever optimization introduces two fundamental challenges: 1) the deterministic retrieval is incompatible with RL formulations, and 2) state aliasing arises from query-only retrieval in multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, we replace deterministic retrieval with stochastic sampling and formulate RAG as a Markov decision process, making retriever optimizable by RL. Further, we incorporate retrieval history into the state at each retrieval step to mitigate state aliasing.

Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), we propose a pretrain-then-finetune approach built on a designed Transformer model to address this challenge. The model is first pretrained on large-scale, domain-informed synthetic data that encode managerial knowledge and structural features of the decision environment, and is then fine-tuned on real observations. This new pipeline offers two complementary advantages: pretraining injects domain knowledge into the learning process and enables the training of high-capacity models using abundant synthetic data, while finetuning adapts the pretrained model to the operational environment and improves alignment with the true data-generating regime. While we have leveraged the Transformer's state-of-the-art representational capacity, particularly its attention mechanism, to efficiently extract cross-task structure, our approach is not an off-the-shelf application. Instead, it relies on problem-specific architectural design and a tailored training procedure to match the decision setting. Theoretically, we develop the first comprehensive error analysis regarding Transformer learning in relevant contexts, establishing nonasymptotic guarantees that validate the method's effectiveness. Critically, our analysis reveals how pretraining and fine-tuning jointly determine performance, with the dominant contribution governed by whichever is more favorable. In particular, finetuning exhibits an economies-of-scale effect, whereby transfer learning becomes increasingly effective as the number of instances grows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u7ba1\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8eTransformer\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5168\u9762\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u5230\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5fc5\u987b\u540c\u65f6\u505a\u51fa\u8bb8\u591a\u8fd0\u8425\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u4ea7\u54c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u597d\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u5728\u5305\u542b\u7ba1\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ca\u51b3\u7b56\u73af\u5883\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3) \u968f\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u4e0bTransformer\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u5171\u540c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u7684\u4e00\u65b9\u8d77\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u6a21\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u5b9a\u5236\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Since full retraining is expensive, prior work has explored efficient alternatives such as model editing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, these approaches often break down in practice due to poor generalization across inputs, limited stability, and knowledge conflict. To address these limitations, we propose the CoRSA (Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization) training framework, a parameter-efficient, holistic approach for knowledge editing with multiple updates. CoRSA tackles multiple challenges simultaneously: it improves generalization to different input forms and enhances stability across multiple updates by minimizing loss curvature, and resolves conflicts by maximizing the margin between new and prior knowledge. Across three widely used fact editing benchmarks, CoRSA achieves significant gains in generalization, outperforming baselines with average absolute improvements of 12.42% over LoRA and 10% over model editing methods. With multiple updates, it maintains high update efficacy while reducing catastrophic forgetting by 27.82% compared to LoRA. CoRSA also generalizes to the code domain, outperforming the strongest baseline by 5.48% Pass@5 in update efficacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoRSA\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5168\u65b9\u4f4d\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002CoRSA\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCoRSA\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9886\u57df\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5bfb\u627e\u9ad8\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCoRSA\uff08Conflict-Resolving and Sharpness-Aware Minimization\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\u66f2\u7387\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u591a\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b0\u65e7\u77e5\u8bc6\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6765\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCoRSA\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eLoRA\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u4e8612.42%\uff0c\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u51fa10%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u7ecf\u5386\u591a\u6b21\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8627.82%\u3002\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0cCoRSA\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u540c\u6837\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0cPass@5\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.48%\u3002", "conclusion": "CoRSA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u591a\u8f6e\u66f4\u65b0\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002"}}

Despite this, most existing pretraining recipes are not anytime: they rely on horizon-dependent learning rate schedules and extensive tuning under a fixed compute budget. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the existence of anytime learning schedules for overparameterized linear regression, and we highlight the central role of weight averaging - also known as model merging - in achieving the minimax convergence rates of stochastic gradient descent. We show that these anytime schedules polynomially decay with time, with the decay rate determined by the source and capacity conditions of the problem. Empirically, we evaluate 150M and 300M parameter language models trained at 1-32x Chinchilla scale, comparing constant learning rates with weight averaging and $1/\\sqrt{t}$ schedules with weight averaging against a well-tuned cosine schedule. Across the full training range, the anytime schedules achieve comparable final loss to cosine decay. Taken together, our results suggest that weight averaging combined with simple, horizon-free step sizes offers a practical and effective anytime alternative to cosine learning rate schedules for large language model pretraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\uff08\u4e5f\u79f0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6b65\u957f\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4f59\u5f26\u8870\u51cf\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u635f\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u603b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6216\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\u63d0\u4f9b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u5408\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5b89\u6392\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\uff08\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff09\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86150M\u548c300M\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u6052\u5b9a\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5\u53ca$1/\\sqrt{t}$\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u826f\u597d\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u91c7\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u8870\u51cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u635f\u5931\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6743\u91cd\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u4e0a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u3001\u65e0\u89c6\u91ce\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6b65\u957f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5176\u6548\u679c\u53ef\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8c03\u6574\u8fc7\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\u3002"}}

Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we propose off-policy log-dispersion regularization (LDR), a novel regularization framework that builds on a generalization of the log-variance objective. We apply LDR in the off-policy setting in combination with standard data-based training objectives, without requiring additional on-policy samples. LDR acts as a shape regularizer of the energy landscape by leveraging additional information in the form of target energy labels. The proposed regularization framework is broadly applicable, supporting unbiased or biased simulation datasets as well as purely variational training without access to target samples. Across all benchmarks, LDR improves both final performance and data efficiency, with sample efficiency gains of up to one order of magnitude.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08LDR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8Boltzmann\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002Boltzmann\u751f\u6210\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u5730\u4ece\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6e29\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684Boltzmann\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u6210\u529f\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u5f88\u9ad8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08LDR\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08LDR\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u65b9\u5dee\u76ee\u6807\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528LDR\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0a\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u80fd\u91cf\u6807\u7b7e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u989d\u5916\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5145\u5f53\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "LDR\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u8fbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u504f\u6216\u6709\u504f\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7eaf\u7cb9\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6570\u5206\u6563\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08LDR\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584Boltzmann\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, a critical bottleneck hindering its scalability is the $\u0398(m)$ time complexity required to execute the exponential mechanism in each iteration. We introduce a modification to the MWEM framework that improves the per-iteration runtime dependency to $\u0398(\\sqrt{m})$ in expectation. This is done via a lazy sampling approach to the Report-Noisy-Max mechanism, which we implement efficiently using Gumbel noise and a $k$-Nearest Neighbor data structure. This allows for the rapid selection of the approximate score in the exponential mechanism without an exhaustive linear scan.

We trace this trade-off to a key mechanism: diffusion models are trained to jointly predict a distribution over all unknown tokens, including those that will not actually be decoded in the current step. Ablating this joint prediction yields faster inference but degrades performance, revealing that accurate prediction at the decoded position relies on joint reasoning about the distribution of undecoded tokens. We interpret these as latent tokens and introduce a method for modulating their number, demonstrating empirically that this enables a smooth tradeoff between inference speed and sample quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that latent tokens can be introduced into autoregressive models through an auxiliary multi-token prediction objective, yielding substantial improvements on the same reasoning tasks where they have traditionally struggled. Our results suggest that latent tokens, while arising naturally in diffusion, represent a general mechanism for improving performance on tasks requiring global coherence or lookahead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u91cf\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u5728\u9700\u8981\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u9020\u6210\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u7801\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5bf9\u672a\u89e3\u7801\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u8fd9\u4e9b\u88ab\u89c6\u4f5c\u2018\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u2019\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u8f6c\u6362\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u52a0\u5feb\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u8a00\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u6539\u5584\u8981\u6c42\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u524d\u5411\u770b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) operates over fixed problem distributions and training budgets, which limits extrapolation amidst distribution shift at test time. To address this, we introduce RC, an iterative decoding algorithm that replaces standard autoregressive decoding during both training and inference. RC exploits an asymmetry between the response generation and summarization capabilities of LLMs to construct reasoning chains that consistently improve across iterations. Models trained to use RC can extrapolate and continually improve over reasoning horizons more than an order of magnitude longer than those seen during training. Empirically, training a 4B model with RC using a 16k-token training budget improves performance on HMMT 2025 from 40% to nearly 70% with 0.5m tokens at test time, outperforming both comparably sized models and many larger reasoning LLMs. Finally, we also show that models trained with RC can more effectively leverage existing scaffolds to further scale test-time performance, due to the improved summary-conditioned generation abilities learned through training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5RC\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u603b\u7ed3\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0cRC\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u957f\u5f97\u591a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u56f4\u4e5f\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RC\u8bad\u7ec3\u76844B\u6a21\u578b\u5728HMMT 2025\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4ece40%\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u4e86\u8fd170%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6807\u51c6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u5e03\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u9047\u5230\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5916\u63a8\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u521d\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ee7\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u81ea\u8eab\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u52a0\u590d\u6742\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRC\u7684\u65b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u89e3\u7801\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u3002RC\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e0e\u603b\u7ed3\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u51fa\u968f\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u4e0d\u65ad\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u6761\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528RC\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a40\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728HMMT 2025\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684token\u6570\u91cf\u8fbe\u523050\u4e07\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u753140%\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd170%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u751a\u81f3\u90e8\u5206\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u578bLLM\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cRC\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u95f4\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cRC\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fdc\u8d85\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u6240\u89c1\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5916\u63a8\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8868\u660e\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5b9a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a continuous variable. However, unless restricted to a specialized class of admissible value functions, this formulation induces sparse rewards and degenerate fixed points. In this work, we propose a novel formulation of the static CVaR objective based on augmentation. Our alternative approach leads to a Bellman operator with: (1) dense per-step rewards; (2) contracting properties on the full space of bounded value functions. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop risk-averse value iteration and model-free Q-learning algorithms that rely on discretized augmented states. We further provide convergence guarantees and approximation error bounds due to discretization.

Existing unlearning methods, which often provide provable guarantees, typically involve retraining a subset of model parameters based on a forget set. While these approaches show promise in certain scenarios, their underlying assumptions are often challenged in real-world applications -- particularly when applied to generative models. Furthermore, updating parameters using these unlearning procedures often degrades the general-purpose capabilities the model acquired during pre-training. Motivated by these shortcomings, this paper considers the paradigm of inference time unlearning -- wherein, the generative model is equipped with an (approximately correct) verifier that judges whether the model's response satisfies appropriate unlearning guarantees. This paper introduces a framework that iteratively refines the quality of the generated responses using feedback from the verifier without updating the model parameters. The proposed framework leverages conformal prediction to reduce computational overhead and provide distribution-free unlearning guarantees. This paper's approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing unlearning error by up to 93% across challenging unlearning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6765\u5224\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5176\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\u5e38\u5e38\u53d7\u5230\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9057\u5fd8\u7a0b\u5e8f\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u83b7\u5f97\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u63d0\u9ad8\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe93%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u79fb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approximation mechanisms that otherwise, in general scenarios, cannot be derived analytically. MRFs provide positive and bounded features, a key property for accurate, low-variance approximation. We show deep asymptotic connection between GRFs, defined on discrete graph objects, and continuous random features used for regular kernels. As a by-product of our method, we re-discover recently introduced mechanism of Gaussian kernel approximation applied in particular to improve linear-attention Transformers, considering simple random walks on graphs and by-passing original complex mathematical computations. We complement our algorithm with a rigorous theoretical analysis and verify in thorough experimental studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u6d41\u5f62\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\uff08MRFs\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6838\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u548c\u56fe\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u4e14\u6709\u754c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8fd8\u91cd\u65b0\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u673a\u5236\u7279\u522b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u6838\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u624b\u6bb5\u627e\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Manifold Random Features (MRFs)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u53ca\u56fe\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81(Graph Random Features, GRFs)\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u6216\u6838\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u53caGraph Random Features (GRFs)\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u573a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u573a\u968f\u540e\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u901a\u5e38\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5bfc\u51fa\u89e3\u6790\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86GRFs\u4e0e\u5e38\u89c4\u6838\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u6df1\u523b\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMRFs\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u4e14\u6709\u754c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u975e\u5e38\u5173\u952e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u526f\u4ea7\u54c1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u518d\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u8fd1\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\u8fd1\u4f3c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7b80\u5316\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u5b66\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Manifold Random Features (MRFs)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u53cc\u53d8\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6df1\u523b\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u5c3d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

These interventions provide an important signal about where the current policy needs improvement, but are often noisy and incomplete. We define Robust Intervention Learning (RIL) as the problem of learning from intervention data while remaining robust to the quality and informativeness of the intervention signal. In the best case, interventions are precise and avoiding them is sufficient to solve the task, but in many realistic settings avoiding interventions is necessary but not sufficient for achieving good performance. We study robust intervention learning in the context of emergency stop interventions and propose Residual Intervention Fine-Tuning (RIFT), a residual fine-tuning algorithm that treats intervention feedback as an incomplete learning signal and explicitly combines it with a prior policy. By framing intervention learning as a fine-tuning problem, our approach leverages structure encoded in the prior policy to resolve ambiguity when intervention signals under-specify the task. We provide theoretical analysis characterizing conditions under which this formulation yields principled policy improvement, and identify regimes where intervention learning is expected to fail. Our experiments reveal that residual fine-tuning enables robust and consistent policy improvement across a range of intervention strategies and prior policy qualities, and highlight robust intervention learning as a promising direction for future work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e72\u9884\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RIFT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u4e3a\u5fae\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u660e\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRIFT\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u662f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u89c1\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5e72\u9884\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u4e4b\u5904\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u6b8b\u5dee\u5e72\u9884\u5fae\u8c03\uff08RIFT\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u5e72\u9884\u53cd\u9988\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u660e\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5148\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u628a\u5e72\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u5148\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5f53\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\u8fd8\u662f\u9762\u5bf9\u5404\u79cd\u54c1\u8d28\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cRIFT\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u4f55\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u9884\u671f\u4e2d\u5e72\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u5e72\u9884\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u5230\u6709\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u9c81\u68d2\u5e72\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

However, in bandwidth-constrained distributed RL, scalability is often bottlenecked by the synchronization of policy weights from trainers to inference workers, particularly over commodity networks or in decentralized settings. While recent studies suggest that RL updates modify only a small fraction of model parameters, these observations are typically based on coarse checkpoint differences. We present a systematic empirical study of weight-update sparsity at both step-level and multi-step granularities, examining its evolution across training dynamics, off-policy delay, and model scale. We find that update sparsity is consistently high, frequently exceeding 99% across practically relevant settings. Leveraging this structure, we propose PULSE (Patch Updates via Lossless Sparse Encoding), a simple yet highly efficient lossless weight synchronization method that transmits only the indices and values of modified parameters. PULSE is robust to transmission errors and avoids floating-point drift inherent in additive delta schemes. In bandwidth-constrained decentralized environments, our approach achieves over 100x (14 GB to ~108 MB) communication reduction while maintaining bit-identical training dynamics and performance compared to full weight synchronization. By exploiting this structure, PULSE enables decentralized RL training to approach centralized throughput, reducing the bandwidth required for weight synchronization from 20 Gbit/s to 0.2 Gbit/s to maintain high GPU utilization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u975e\u5e38\u9ad8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PULSE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7100\u500d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5168\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u6216\u5206\u6563\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u8005\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u653f\u7b56\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eRL\u66f4\u65b0\u53ea\u4fee\u6539\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c2\u5bdf\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7c97\u7565\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5dee\u5f02\u5f97\u51fa\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u6b65\u957f\u7ea7\u548c\u591a\u6b65\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ee5\u53ca\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PULSE\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u635f\u7a00\u758f\u7f16\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u4e01\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u5374\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u88ab\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u548c\u503c\u3002", "result": "PULSE\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7100\u500d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\uff08\u4ece14GB\u964d\u81f3\u7ea6108MB\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u5168\u6743\u91cd\u540c\u6b65\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0cPULSE\u4f7f\u6240\u9700\u5e26\u5bbd\u4ece20Gbit/s\u964d\u81f30.2Gbit/s\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8GPU\u5229\u7528\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0cPULSE\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \\emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, redundant neurons provide a proxy for dominant pretraining-era feature directions, enabling the construction of approximately protected update subspaces directly from pretrained weights. Second, redundancy offers a natural bias for \\emph{where} to place plasticity: by restricting updates to a subset of redundant neurons and constraining the remaining degrees of freedom, we obtain update families with reduced functional drift on the old-data distribution and improved worst-case retention guarantees. These insights lead to \\textsc{PLATE} (\\textbf{Pla}sticity-\\textbf{T}unable \\textbf{E}fficient Adapters), a continual learning method requiring no past-task data that provides explicit control over the plasticity-retention trade-off. PLATE parameterizes each layer with a structured low-rank update $\u0394W = B A Q^\\top$, where $B$ and $Q$ are computed once from pretrained weights and kept frozen, and only $A$ is trained on the new task.
