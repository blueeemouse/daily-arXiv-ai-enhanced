Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments. Models fine-tuned on RAG-IGBench's training set exhibit improved performance across multiple benchmarks, confirming both the quality and practical utility of our dataset.

A broad class of such tasks involves a semantic join-joining two tables based on a natural language predicate per pair of tuples, evaluated using an LLM. Semantic joins generalize tasks such as entity matching and record categorization, as well as more complex text understanding tasks. A naive implementation is expensive as it requires invoking an LLM for every pair of rows in the cross product. Existing approaches mitigate this cost by first applying embedding-based semantic similarity to filter candidate pairs, deferring to an LLM only when similarity scores are deemed inconclusive. However, these methods yield limited gains in practice, since semantic similarity may not reliably predict the join outcome. We propose Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ for short), a novel approach for performing semantic joins that significantly reduces cost while preserving quality. FDJ automatically extracts features and combines them into a logical expression in conjunctive normal form that we call a featurized decomposition to effectively prune out non-matching pairs. A featurized decomposition extracts key information from text records and performs inexpensive comparisons on the extracted features. We show how to use LLMs to automatically extract reliable features and compose them into logical expressions while providing statistical guarantees on the output result-an inherently challenging problem due to dependencies among features. Experiments on real-world datasets show up to 10 times reduction in cost compared with the state-of-the-art while providing the same quality guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u63a5\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\u65f6\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ) \u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u5408\u53d6\u8303\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6765\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6392\u9664\u975e\u5339\u914d\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u7ec4\u6210\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cFDJ\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u591a\u8fbe10\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "Featurized-Decomposition Join (FDJ) \u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6587\u672c\u5b57\u6bb5\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u7ed3\u679c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as automated assessors, showing promising alignment with human annotations. Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u6458\u8981\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff08IR\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6587\u5224\u65ad\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8005\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u6587\u6863\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2aTREC\u96c6\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u6587\u6863\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6LLM\u751f\u6210\u6458\u8981\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9IR\u7cfb\u7edf\u6392\u540d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6458\u8981\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5224\u65ad\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7ef4\u6301IR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6392\u540d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u53ca\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u5f02\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u7ed3\u6280\u672f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21IR\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u4f1a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u5224\u65ad\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9020\u6210\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge.

With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems, a subclass of the temporal graph, i.e., Property Evolution Temporal Graph, in which the value of properties on nodes or edges changes frequently while the graph's topology barely changes, is growing rapidly. However, existing temporal graph management solutions are not oriented to the Property Evolution Temporal Graph data, which leads to highly complex data modeling and low-performance query processing of temporal graph queries. To solve these problems, we developed PETGraph, a data management system for Property Evolution Temporal Graph data. PETGraph adopts a valid-time temporal property graph data model to facilitate data modeling, supporting ACID features with transactions. To improve temporal graph query performance, we designed a space-efficient temporal property storage and a fine-granularity multi-level locking mechanism. Experimental results show that PETGraph requires, on average, only 33% of the storage space needed by the current best data management solution. Additionally, it achieves an average of 58.8 times higher transaction throughput in HTAP workloads compared to the best current solutions and outperforms them by an average of 267 times in query latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edfPETGraph\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\uff08Property Evolution Temporal Graph\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u53ca\u9501\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\uff0cPETGraph\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e00\u7c7b\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u2014\u2014\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u6b63\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u56fe\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u662f\u8282\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\u4e0a\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u503c\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u800c\u56fe\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u7ba1\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PETGraph\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u65f6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5177\u6709ACID\u7279\u6027\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8282\u7701\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u6001\u5c5e\u6027\u5b58\u50a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u9501\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cPETGraph\u5e73\u5747\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6240\u9700\u5b58\u50a8\u7a7a\u95f4\u768433%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728HTAP\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0b\uff0c\u5176\u4e8b\u52a1\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u9ad8\u51fa\u5e73\u574758.8\u500d\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5219\u5feb\u51fa\u5e73\u5747267\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "PETGraph\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5c5e\u6027\u6f14\u53d8\u65f6\u6001\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u590d\u6742\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u548c\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u6bb5\u843d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u548c\u6734\u7d20\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86TF-IDF\u52a0\u6743\u5d4c\u5165\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5d4c\u5165\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u91c7\u7528\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u5757\u52a0\u4e0aTF-IDF\u52a0\u6743\u5d4c\u5165\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523082.5%\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u7eaf\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u6cd5\u768473.3%\u3002\u6734\u7d20\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u524d\u7f00\u878d\u5408\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684Hit Rate@10\uff0c\u4e3a0.925\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u5411\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u662f\u4f18\u5316RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u4f01\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u610f\u5927\u5229\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u60e0\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u8de8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8de8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u6392\u540d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u672f\u8bed\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u6765\u6539\u5584\u6559\u80b2\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u7684RAG\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eWikidata\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u94fe\u63a5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u5f97\u5206\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u4e92\u60e0\u7b49\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u91cd\u6392\u5668\u2014\u2014\u4ee5\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u60e0\u6392\u540d\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u597d\u7684\u6210\u7ee9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6392\u540d\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u578bRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u8f85\u5bfc\u5de5\u5177\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Consequently, software engineering education must adapt to ensure that students not only learn traditional development methods but also understand how to meaningfully and responsibly use these new technologies. In particular, project-based courses offer an effective environment to explore and evaluate the integration of AI assistance into real-world development practices. This paper presents our approach and a user study conducted within a university programming project in which students collaboratively developed computer games. The study investigates how participants used generative AI tools throughout different phases of the software development process, identifies the types of tasks where such tools were most effective, and analyzes the challenges students encountered. Building on these insights, we further examine a repository-aware, locally deployed large language model (LLM) assistant designed to provide project-contextualized support. The system employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground responses in relevant documentation and source code, enabling qualitative analysis of model behavior, parameter sensitivity, and common failure modes. The findings deepen our understanding of context-aware AI support in educational software projects and inform future integration of AI-based assistance into software engineering curricula.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u7684\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u3001\u5b83\u4eec\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\u4ee5\u53ca\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u6280\u672f\u7684\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a9\u624b\uff0c\u8be5\u52a9\u624b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u8fc5\u901f\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u5f0f\u6b63\u5728\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b66\u751f\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u5730\u548c\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u4f7f\u7528\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6559\u80b2\u5fc5\u987b\u4f5c\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06AI\u8f85\u52a9\u878d\u5165\u5b9e\u9645\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u5b66\u7f16\u7a0b\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u4eec\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u53d1\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6e38\u620f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5982\u4f55\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4ed3\u5e93\u610f\u8bc6\u7684\u3001\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u52a9\u7406\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u9879\u76ee\u80cc\u666f\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u6863\u548c\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u5e38\u89c1\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u4e5f\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7406\u89e3AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u6216\u5904\u7406AI\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4ed3\u5e93\u611f\u77e5\u578bLLM\u52a9\u7406\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u5e2e\u52a9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u5982\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6559\u80b2\u8f6f\u4ef6\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5AI\u652f\u6301\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

LLMs require few, if any, training examples and can be utilized by users without expertise in model development. However, this comes at the cost of substantially higher resource and energy consumption compared to smaller models, which often achieve similar predictive performance for simple tasks. In this paper, we present our vision for just-in-time model replacement (JITR), where, upon identifying a recurring task in calls to an LLM, the model is replaced transparently with a cheaper alternative that performs well for this specific task. JITR retains the ease of use and low development effort of LLMs, while saving significant cost and energy. We discuss the main challenges in realizing our vision regarding the identification of recurring tasks and the creation of a custom model. Specifically, we argue that model search and transfer learning will play a crucial role in JITR to efficiently identify and fine-tune models for a recurring task. Using our JITR prototype Poodle, we achieve significant savings for exemplary tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\uff08JITR\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u900f\u660e\u5730\u66ff\u6362\u6210\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u8282\u7701\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u80fd\u6e90\u3002JITR\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u7b80\u4fbf\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f01\u4e1a\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7b80\u5355\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u800c\u975e\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u6837\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\uff08JITR\uff09\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5728\u7ef4\u6301LLMs\u6613\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u66f4\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u8282\u7ea6\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u3002", "method": "JITR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6d89\u53ca\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5bf9LLM\u8bf7\u6c42\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5728\u786e\u8ba4\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6216\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0JITR\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u662f\u5173\u952e\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u67d0\u4e00\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u540d\u4e3aPoodle\u7684JITR\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u67d0\u4e9b\u793a\u4f8b\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7701\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5373\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u66ff\u6362\uff08JITR\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fbf\u5229\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u8fd0\u884c\u6210\u672c\u53ca\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u8981\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0JITR\u613f\u666f\u8fd8\u9700\u514b\u670d\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u53ca\u600e\u6837\u5feb\u901f\u6784\u5efa\u6216\u8c03\u6574\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We report a two-phase qualitative study with 20 software engineers to understand this. In Phase I, participants exchanged peer reviews and were interviewed about their affective responses and engagement decisions. In Phase II, we introduced a new prompt matching engineers' preferences and probed how characteristics shaped their reactions. We develop an integrative account linking emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution. We identify self-regulation strategies that engineers use to regulate their emotions in response to negative feedback: reframing, dialogic regulation, avoidance, and defensiveness. Engagement proceeds through social calibration; engineers align their responses and behaviors to the relational climate and team norms. Trajectories to resolution, in the case of peer-led review, vary by locus (solo/dyad/team) and an internal sense-making process. With the LLM-assisted review, emotional costs and the need for self-regulation seem lower. When LLM feedback aligned with engineers' cognitive expectations, participants reported reduced processing effort and a potentially higher tendency to adopt. We show that LLM-assisted review redirects engagement from emotion management to cognitive load management. We contribute an integrative model of engagement that links emotional self-regulation to behavioral engagement and resolution, showing how affective and cognitive processes influence feedback adoption in peer-led and LLM-assisted code reviews. We conclude that AI is best positioned as a supportive partner to reduce cognitive and emotional load while preserving human accountability and the social meaning of peer review and similar socio-technical activities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u540c\u884c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\uff0c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u8c03\u8282\u9700\u6c42\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u91c7\u7eb3\u53cd\u9988\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u60c5\u7eea\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8baeAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u4f19\u4f34\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d23\u4efb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u5982\u4f55\u53c2\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u540c\u884c\u9886\u5bfc\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f83\u5c11\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u8bdd\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u3001\u53c2\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u4ee5\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5305\u62ec\u540c\u884c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4ea4\u6d41\u548c\u4e2a\u4eba\u8bbf\u8c08\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5219\u5f15\u5165\u7b26\u5408\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b0\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6536\u96c6\u5230\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u8d26\u6237\uff0c\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u53ca\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "result": "\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u51e0\u79cd\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u56de\u907f\u548c\u9632\u5fa1\u6027\u3002\u53c2\u4e0e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a\u6821\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\uff1b\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6839\u636e\u5173\u7cfb\u6c14\u5019\u548c\u56e2\u961f\u89c4\u8303\u8c03\u6574\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u540c\u884c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8def\u5f84\u56e0\u7126\u70b9\uff08\u4e2a\u4eba/\u53cc\u4eba/\u56e2\u961f\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u4e49\u6784\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u800c\u5728LLM\u8f85\u52a9\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u7eea\u6210\u672c\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u4f3c\u4e4e\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002\u5f53LLM\u53cd\u9988\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u9884\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u65f6\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u8bf4\u5904\u7406\u52aa\u529b\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91c7\u7eb3\u503e\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u53c2\u4e0e\u4ece\u60c5\u7eea\u7ba1\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u7ba1\u7406\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u6765\u8bf4\u660e\u60c5\u611f\u81ea\u6211\u8c03\u8282\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u884c\u4e3a\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u540c\u884c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u53cd\u9988\u91c7\u7eb3\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u8bba\u662fAI\u6700\u9002\u5408\u626e\u6f14\u652f\u6301\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u7c7b\u8d23\u4efb\u611f\u53ca\u540c\u884c\u5ba1\u67e5\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u6d3b\u52a8\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Accepted at Machine Learning for Health (ML4H) 2025, Proceedings of the Machine Learning Research (PMLR)", "summary": "Masked autoencoders (MAEs) are increasingly applied to electronic health records (EHR) for learning general-purpose representations that support diverse clinical tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565CV-Masking\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCV-Masking\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08MAEs\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u4e00\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u8f83\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u5219\u6ce2\u52a8\u8f83\u5927\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u6ce2\u52a8\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u6025\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3aCV-Masking\u7684\u65b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u53ea\u9488\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7b26\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCV-Masking\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u7684EHR\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165CV-Masking\u8fd9\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes.\n  WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success. The findings provide evidence-based guidance for large-scale AI tool deployment in compliance-relevant environments, showing that effective human-AI collaboration, not full automation, drives sustainable business impact.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86WhatsCode\u5728WhatsApp\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u8be5AI\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u4ee3\u7801\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u572825\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f01\u4e1a\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6210\u529f\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b66\u672f\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5408\u89c4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5927\u578b\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72AI\u8f85\u52a9\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u4f46\u884c\u4e1a\u91c7\u7528\u5374\u5728\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57dfAI\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edfWhatsCode\u5728WhatsApp\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc725\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5bf9WhatsCode\u8fdb\u884c\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u4ece\u9690\u79c1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5230\u81ea\u4e3b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u4e5f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9690\u79c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "WhatsCode\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9690\u79c1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u81f33.5\u500d\uff08\u4ece15%\u63d0\u9ad8\u523053%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc73,000\u6b21\u88ab\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6539\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e00\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u53d8\u66f4\uff08\u536060%\uff09\uff1b\u6307\u6325-\u4fee\u8ba2\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\uff08\u536040%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u529b\u5916\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u7b49\u7ec4\u7ec7\u56e0\u7d20\u4e5f\u662f\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f01\u4e1a\u7ea7AI\u9879\u76ee\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5426\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\u3002\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u5458\u4e0eAI\u5408\u4f5c\u800c\u975e\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\uff0c\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6301\u7eed\u5546\u4e1a\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6240\u5728\u3002"}}

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u6709\u65f6\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u6240\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\uff1b\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u8fdc\u8d85\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5927\u578b\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u660e\u663e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u518d\u5165\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7248\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u9700\u6c42\u5c11\u5f97\u591a\uff1b\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f73\u5206\u8bcd\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Fixed-site edge servers at Road Side Units (RSUs) or base stations are able to offer basic service coverage for end users, i.e., vehicles on road. However, the server locations and capacity are fixed after deployment, rendering their inefficiency in handling spationtemporal user dynamics. Mobile servers such as buses, on the other hand, have the potential of adding computation elasticity to such system. To this end, this paper studies the feasibility of bus-mounted edge servers based on real traces. First, we investigate the coverage of the buses and base stations using the Shanghai bus/taxi/Telecom datasets, which shows a great potential of bus-based edge servers as they cover a great portion of geographic area and demand points. Next, we build a mathematical model and design a simple greedy heuristic algorithm to select a limited number of buses that maximizes the coverage of demand points, i.e., with a limited purchase budget. We perform trace-driven simulations to verify the performance of the proposed bus selection algorithm. The results show that our approach effectively handles the dynamic user demand under realistic constraints such as server capacity and purchase quantity.

In response, we propose a hybrid methodological approach that integrates InclusiveMag's inclusivity framework with the GenderMag walkthrough process, tailored to the context of neurodivergent women in SE. The overarching design unfolds across three stages, scoping through literature review, deriving personas and analytic processes, and applying the method in collaborative workshops. We present a targeted literature review that synthesize challenges into cognitive, social, organizational, structural and career progression challenges neurodivergent women face in SE, including how under/late diagnosis and masking intensify exclusion.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms.

However, optimizing scheduling for serverless functions remains challenging due to their dynamic and event-driven nature. While data locality has been proven effective in traditional cluster computing systems through delay scheduling, its application in serverless platforms remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we systematically evaluate existing delay scheduling methods in serverless environments and identify three key observations: 1) delay scheduling benefits vary significantly based on function input characteristics; 2) serverless computing exhibits more complex locality patterns than cluster computing systems, encompassing both data locality and infrastructure locality; and 3) heterogeneous function execution times make rule-based delay thresholds ineffective. Based on these insights, we propose Metronome, a differentiated delay scheduling framework that employs predictive mechanisms to identify optimal locality-aware nodes for individual functions. Metronome leverages an online Random Forest Regression model to forecast function execution times across various nodes, enabling informed delay decisions while preventing SLA violations. Our implementation on OpenLambda shows that Metronome significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 64.88%-95.83% reduction in mean execution time for functions, while maintaining performance advantages under increased concurrency levels and ensuring SLA compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u89c2\u5bdf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Metronome\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u51fd\u6570\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1SLA\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u8c03\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u96c6\u7fa4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5176\u5728\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ecd\u5f85\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMetronome\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u7ebf\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u540c\u8282\u70b9\u4e0a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u505a\u51fa\u660e\u667a\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cMetronome\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5c06\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e64.88%-95.83%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e76\u53d1\u6c34\u5e73\u63d0\u9ad8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u7b26\u5408SLA\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "Metronome\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e14\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cdSLA\u3002"}}

While mainframes are generally dependable, they can be difficult to maintain due to their high maintenance costs, the shortage of skills, and the problems in integrating them with cloud-based systems. By adopting AI-driven modernization strategies such as automated code refactoring, migration of data using smart tools, and predictive maintenance, companies can easily move to microservices, containerized environments, and hybrid cloud platforms. Machine learning models have the capability to go through legacy codebases, figure out efficiency opportunities, and carry out automated testing and deployment. Besides that, AI improves the organization's operational efficiency by generating the insights that can be used to level the workload and detect the anomalies. The coupling of the two is not only about saving the core business logic but also about enabling quicker innovation, less downtime, and enhanced system resilience.

While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process.

Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs.

The emerging challenge is no longer model fine-tuning but context engineering-how systems capture, structure, and govern external knowledge, memory, tools, and human input to enable trustworthy reasoning. Existing practices such as prompt engineering, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and tool integration remain fragmented, producing transient artefacts that limit traceability and accountability. This paper proposes a file-system abstraction for context engineering, inspired by the Unix notion that 'everything is a file'. The abstraction offers a persistent, governed infrastructure for managing heterogeneous context artefacts through uniform mounting, metadata, and access control. Implemented within the open-source AIGNE framework, the architecture realises a verifiable context-engineering pipeline, comprising the Context Constructor, Loader, and Evaluator, that assembles, delivers, and validates context under token constraints. As GenAI becomes an active collaborator in decision support, humans play a central role as curators, verifiers, and co-reasoners. The proposed architecture establishes a reusable foundation for accountable and human-centred AI co-work, demonstrated through two exemplars: an agent with memory and an MCP-based GitHub assistant. The implementation within the AIGNE framework demonstrates how the architecture can be operationalised in developer and industrial settings, supporting verifiable, maintainable, and industry-ready GenAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper introduces a file-system abstraction for context engineering in generative AI, aiming to improve the management of external knowledge and human input.

The former provides correctness guarantees but are rigid for complex requirements, whereas LLMs offer high flexibility at the risk of producing faulty code.This paper proposes iEcoreGen, a hybrid approach that integrates Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and LLMs. In EMF, an Ecore model defines a system structure and acts as a blueprint for code-generation.iEcoreGen decomposes requirements to derive operation specifications, uses EMF's template-based generator to produce initial Java code, and serializes specifications into docstrings. LLMs are then invoked to complete and fix unimplemented methods. We assessed iEcoreGen on twenty code-generation tasks across five LLMs. It surpasses LLM-only baselines on pass@k and performs on par with them on compilation@k. An ablation study clarified the contribution of each component of iEcoreGen. Overall, the findings indicate that LLM-enhanced model-driven development is a promising path toward more efficient software automation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aiEcoreGen\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Eclipse\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6\uff08EMF\uff09\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528EMF\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u521d\u59cbJava\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u5b8c\u6210\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0ciEcoreGen\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u8bd1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u677f\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u975e\u5e38\u7075\u6d3b\u5374\u53ef\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u9700\u6c42\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "iEcoreGen\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) \u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684Ecore\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u6784\u84dd\u56fe\uff0c\u63a5\u7740\u5c06\u9700\u6c42\u62c6\u89e3\u6210\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u518d\u7528EMF\u81ea\u5e26\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u677f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u521d\u6b65\u7684Java\u4ee3\u7801\u53ca\u6587\u6863\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8bf4\u660e\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u8c03\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8865\u5145\u548c\u5b8c\u5584\u90a3\u4e9b\u5c1a\u672a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "iEcoreGen\u5728\u4e8c\u5341\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728pass@k\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b83\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u5728compilation@k\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5219\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u5f00\u53d1\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u9014\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f6f\u4ef6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u660e\u786e\u4e86iEcoreGen\u5404\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8d21\u732e\u3002"}}

Current explainable RL methods seldom use state attributions to assist training. Rather, they treat all state features equally, thereby neglecting the heterogeneous impacts of individual state dimensions on the reward. We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term.

For citations, please refer to the published version in the PROFES 2025 proceedings", "summary": "Quality assurance for large-scale cyber-physical systems relies on sophisticated test activities using complex test environments investigated with the help of numerous types of simulators. As these systems grow, extensive resources are required to develop and maintain simulation models of hardware and software components, as well as physical environments. Meanwhile, recent advances in generative AI have led to tools that can produce executable test cases for software systems, offering potential benefits such as reducing manual efforts or increasing test coverage. However, the application of generative AI techniques to simulation-based testing of large-scale cyber-physical systems remains underexplored. To better understand this gap, this study captures practitioners' perspectives on leveraging generative AI, based on a cross-company workshop with six organizations. Our contribution is twofold: (1) detailed, experience-based insights into challenges faced by engineers, and (2) a research agenda comprising three high-priority directions: (a) AI-generated scenarios and environment models, (b) simulators and AI in CI/CD pipelines, and (c) trustworthiness in generative AI for simulation. While participants acknowledged substantial potential, they also highlighted unresolved challenges. By detailing these issues, the paper aims to guide future academia-industry collaboration towards the responsible adoption of generative AI in simulation-based testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u548c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u516d\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u8de8\u516c\u53f8\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\u6536\u96c6\u5b9e\u8df5\u8005\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff1aAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u3001CI/CD\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cAI\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7528\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fe1\u606f\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u7ef4\u62a4\u786c\u4ef6\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u3002\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ecd\u8f83\u5c11\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0e\u516d\u4e2a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5408\u4f5c\u5f00\u5c55\u7684\u8de8\u516c\u53f8\u7814\u8ba8\u4f1a\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u4eec\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u770b\u6cd5\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff1a(a) \u7531AI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\uff0c(b) \u5728\u6301\u7eed\u96c6\u6210/\u6301\u7eed\u90e8\u7f72\uff08CI/CD\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cAI\uff0c(c) \u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u8bb8\u591a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u672a\u6765\u5b66\u672f\u754c\u4e0e\u4ea7\u4e1a\u754c\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ee5\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u7b97\u5b50(CFO)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b(PDE)\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u53d7\u4efb\u610f\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002CFO\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8PDE\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u6eda\u52a8\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5e76\u8981\u6c42\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6807\u51c6\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecfODE\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60PDE\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "method": "CFO\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60PDE\u7684\u53f3\u4fa7\u9879\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u6837\u6761\u62df\u5408\u5230\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u70b9\u5904\u65f6\u95f4\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5dee\u5206\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u7d27\u5bc6\u903c\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684PDE\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u88ab\u8bad\u7ec3\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u6790\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5929\u7136\u5730\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0d\u53d8\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u4ee5\u63a5\u53d7\u4efb\u610f\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7ODE\u79ef\u5206\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u67e5\u8be2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D\u6269\u6563-\u53cd\u5e94, 2D\u6d45\u6c34\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cCFO\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u8ddd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u752825%\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0cCFO\u4e5f\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe87%\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u4f46CFO\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u540e\u8005\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u72ec\u7279\u5730\u652f\u6301\u9006\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "CFO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u53d8PDE\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCFO\u5141\u8bb8\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002"}}

Although prior work notes behavioral and other non-technical factors in AI integration, most studies still emphasize technical concerns and offer limited insight into how teams adapt to and trust AI. This paper proposes a Behavioral Software Engineering (BSE)-informed, human-centric framework to support SE organizations during early AI adoption. Using a mixed-methods approach, we built and refined the framework through a literature review of organizational change models and thematic analysis of interview data, producing concrete, actionable steps. The framework comprises nine dimensions: AI Strategy Design, AI Strategy Evaluation, Collaboration, Communication, Governance and Ethics, Leadership, Organizational Culture, Organizational Dynamics, and Up-skilling, each supported by design principles and actions. To gather preliminary practitioner input, we conducted a survey (N=105) and two expert workshops (N=4). Survey results show that Up-skilling (15.2%) and AI Strategy Design (15.1%) received the highest $100-method allocations, underscoring their perceived importance in early AI initiatives.

Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc7844,000\u6b21\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0CODEOWNERS\u529f\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u4ee3\u7801\u5ba1\u67e5\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e73\u6ed1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d23\u4efb\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u4ed3\u5e93\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5916\u90e8\u5a01\u80c1\u5982\u8f6f\u4ef6\u4f9b\u5e94\u94fe\u653b\u51fb\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9879\u76ee\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u673a\u5236\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002GitHub\u57282017\u5e74\u63a8\u51fa\u4e86CODEOWNERS\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u95ee\u8d23\u5236\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u91c7\u7528\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u60c5\u51b5\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d85\u8fc7844,000\u4e2a\u62c9\u53d6\u8bf7\u6c42\u3001190\u4e07\u6761\u8bc4\u8bba\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u8fc7200\u4e07\u6b21\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e8610,287\u4f4d\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u5ba1\u67e5\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u56de\u5f52\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff08RDD\uff09\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a2\u7a76\u91c7\u7528CODEOWNERS\u524d\u540e\u4ed3\u5e93\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u6240\u6709\u8005\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u9075\u5b88CODEOWNERS\u6587\u4ef6\u4e2d\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6240\u6709\u6743\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u79fb\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u987a\u7545\u66f4\u5feb\u6377\u7684PR\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u91c7\u7eb3CODEOWNERS\u7684\u4ed3\u5e93\u7ecf\u5386\u4e86\u5ba1\u67e5\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5ba1\u67e5\u8d23\u4efb\u4ece\u6838\u5fc3\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u4e86\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6240\u6709\u8005\u8eab\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "CODEOWNERS\u88ab\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u97e7\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3001\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

While detecting LLM-generated text has been extensively studied, distinguishing human vs LLM-generated scientific idea remains an unexplored area. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) machine learning models to differentiate between human and LLM-generated ideas, particularly after successive paraphrasing stages. Our findings highlight the challenges SOTA models face in source attribution, with detection performance declining by an average of 25.4\\% after five consecutive paraphrasing stages. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating the research problem as contextual information improves detection performance by up to 2.97%. Notably, our analysis reveals that detection algorithms struggle significantly when ideas are paraphrased into a simplified, non-expert style, contributing the most to the erosion of distinguishable LLM signatures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6539\u5199\u9636\u6bb5\u4e4b\u540e\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u6b21\u8fde\u7eed\u6539\u5199\u540e\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d25.4%\u3002\u52a0\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe2.97%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u52a9\u624b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u7531LLM\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u68c0\u6d4bLLM\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b83\u4eec\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u60f3\u6cd5\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u8fde\u7eed\u6539\u5199\u8fc7\u7a0b\u540e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u52a0\u5165\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e94\u6b21\u8fde\u7eed\u6539\u5199\u540e\uff0c\u5176\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5e73\u5747\u4e0b\u964d\u4e8625.4%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u4f5c\u4e3a\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u53472.97%\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u60f3\u6cd5\u88ab\u6539\u5199\u6210\u7b80\u5316\u3001\u975e\u4e13\u5bb6\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u6781\u5927\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u533a\u5206LLM\u7279\u5f81\u6d88\u5931\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u591a\u6b21\u6539\u5199\u4ee5\u53ca\u7b80\u5316\u8868\u8ff0\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u63d0\u4f9b\u989d\u5916\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u591f\u7a0d\u5fae\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e0eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u60f3\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Hybrid declarative specifications, utilizing Signal Temporal Logic (STL), address this limitation by allowing constraints over both discrete events and real-valued signals.

This paper introduces a novel Complex Event Processing (CEP)-based execution architecture that enables the real-time execution and enforcement of hybrid declarative models. Our three-layer approach integrates STL-inspired predicates into the execution flow, allowing the system to actively trigger activities and enforce process boundaries based on continuous sensor behavior.

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise.

In such systems, end-to-end user requests traverse multiple different services and machines, exhibiting intricate interactions. Consequently, cloud service systems are vulnerable to concurrency bugs, which pose significant challenges to their reliability. Existing methods for concurrency bug detection often fall short due to their intrusive nature and inability to handle the architectural complexities of microservices. To address these limitations, we propose MicroRacer, a non-intrusive and automated framework for detecting concurrency bugs in such environments. By dynamically instrumenting widely-used libraries at runtime, MicroRacer collects detailed trace data without modifying the application code. Such data are utilized to analyze the happened-before relationship and resource access patterns of common operations within service systems. Based on this information, MicroRacer identifies suspicious concurrent operations and employs a three-stage validation process to test and confirm concurrency bugs.

Stich"], "title": "Non-Convex Federated Optimization under Cost-Aware Client Selection", "comment": null, "summary": "Different federated optimization algorithms typically employ distinct client-selection strategies: some methods communicate only with a randomly sampled subset of clients at each round, while others need to periodically communicate with all clients or use a hybrid scheme that combines both strategies. However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08RG-SAGA\uff09\u548c\u7279\u6b8a\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6307\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u4f1a\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6b64\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSAGA\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u9650\u7684\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668RG-SAGA\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u672c\u5730\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9SAGA\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u5f97\u5230\u7684RG-SAGA\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\u539f\u7248\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6280\u672f\u548c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u6587\u6cd5\u548c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u79cd\u5b50\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177Germinator\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u4e2aMLIR\u9879\u76ee\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8688\u4e2a\u672a\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5176\u4e2d40\u4e2a\u5df2\u786e\u8ba4\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u73b0\u4ee3\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u5982MLIR\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8bed\u8a00\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u521b\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b9\u8a00\u5355\u72ec\u6784\u5efa\u79cd\u5b50\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u627e\u5230\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u624b\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u53c8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9488\u5bf9\u65b9\u8a00\u7279\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u5341\u5206\u5fc5\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u4e14\u53d7\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u65b9\u8a00\u89c4\u8303\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u4f55\u624b\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u521d\u59cb\u8f93\u5165\u968f\u540e\u88ab\u7528\u6765\u542f\u52a8\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u540d\u4e3aGerminator\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f53\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5305\u542b91\u79cd\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u516d\u4e2aMLIR\u9879\u76ee\u65f6\uff0cGerminator\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad810-120%\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u8986\u76d6\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8688\u4e2a\u6b64\u524d\u672a\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u7684bug\uff08\u5176\u4e2d40\u4e2a\u5df2\u88ab\u8bc1\u5b9e\uff09\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e4b\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u8a00\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u8a00\u90fd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u8a00\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u53ca\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

With the help of Large Language Models and their reasoning capabilities, existing systems are able to think and decompose an input question over multiple steps to analyze, retrieve, and reason. However, training-based approaches for this problem still suffer from LLM hallucinations and incorrect reasoning paths that hinder performance. Hence, we propose PATHFINDER, an approach that: (i) uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to generate training path traces, (ii) improves training data quality by filtering erroneous and lengthy traces using sub-answer recall and LLM-as-a-judge verification, and (iii) reformulates sub-queries to handle failed retrieval cases. By following these steps, we demonstrate that PATHFINDER improves the performance of multi-hop QA over public benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPATHFINDER\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u6539\u5584\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ecd\u7136\u53d7\u5230\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7b54\u6848\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9519\u8bef\u53ca\u5197\u957f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u68c0\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u5236\u5b9a\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86PATHFINDER\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "PATHFINDER\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To mitigate these risks, we propose a novel unlearning framework tailored for LLM-based hardware code generation. Our method combines (i) a syntax-preserving unlearning strategy that safeguards the structural integrity of hardware code during forgetting, and (ii) a fine-grained floor-aware selective loss that enables precise and efficient removal of problematic knowledge. This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aConfounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR) \u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7531\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCATR\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8c03\u6574\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u56e0\u7d20\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f16\u7801\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u7ed9\u56e0\u679c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c42\u9762\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff08\u5373\u8981\u6c42\u5728\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u91cd\u53e0\uff09\u65f6\u3002\u5197\u4f59\u6216\u865a\u5047\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u503e\u5411\u5206\u6570\u6781\u7aef\u5316\u3001\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4ee5\u53ca\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u81a8\u80c0\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u8db3\u591f\u6df7\u6dc6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u65e0\u6df7\u6dc6\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u72ec\u7acb\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u5fc5\u9700\u7684token\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e22\u5f03\u65e0\u5173\u7d27\u8981\u7684\u6587\u672c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0cCATR\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u89c2\u5bdf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6b63\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u8fdd\u53cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cCATR\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0cCATR\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u7531\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

While many scoring functions perform well on standard benchmarks, their ability to generalize beyond training data remains a significant challenge. In this work, we evaluate the generalization capability of state-of-the-art scoring functions on dataset splits that simulate evaluation on targets with a limited number of known structures and experimental affinity measurements. Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets. We also investigate whether large-scale self-supervised pretraining can bridge this generalization gap and we provide preliminary evidence of its potential. Furthermore, we probe the efficacy of simple methods that leverage limited test-target data to improve scoring function performance. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous evaluation protocols and offer practical guidance for designing scoring functions with predictive power extending to novel protein targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u6709\u9650\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u65b0\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u9776\u70b9\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bb8\u591a\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u79cd\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u5bdf\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b80\u4fbf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u5411\u65b0\u7684\u9776\u6807\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u6211\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76ee\u6807\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u578b\u86cb\u767d\u9776\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7684\u6253\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa. These results indicate that MineROI-Net offers a practical, data-driven tool for timing mining hardware acquisitions, potentially reducing financial risk in capital-intensive mining operations.

Nevertheless, LLM-driven generation remains challenging: the token-level design loop is discrete and non-differentiable, preventing feedback from smoothly guiding architectural improvement. These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, issues such as missing values and anomalies in sequential data hinder its further development in prediction tasks. Previous research has primarily focused on extracting feature information from sequence data or addressing these suboptimal data as positive samples for knowledge transfer. A more effective approach would be to leverage these non-ideal negative samples to enhance event prediction. In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training.

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u989d\u5916\u597d\u5904\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5219\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u62df\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u5355\u4e2a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u5c0f\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u88ab\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u590d\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u5355\u4e00\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e5d\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e73\u817a\u764c\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u3001\u76ae\u9a6c\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u548c\u4fe1\u7528\u5361\u6b3a\u8bc8\u8fd9\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad85\u52307\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f4e\u4e8e3%\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u566a\u58f0\u5927\u6216\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u907f\u514d\u62df\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u3001Fisher\u6bd4\u7387\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u89e3\u91ca\u4f55\u65f6\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u603b\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u8868\u683c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Two molecular datasets are considered: the simplistic linear shaped LiH-molecule and the trigonal pyramidal molecule NH3. Both accuracy and generalizability metrics are considered. A classical equivariant model is used as a baseline for the performance comparison. The comparative performance of Quantum Machine Learning models with no symmetry equivariance, rotational and permutational equivariance, and graph embedded permutational equivariance is investigated.

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Credal\u548cInterval Deep Evidential Classifications\uff08CDEC\u4e0eIDEC\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u4fe1\u5ea6\u96c6\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u533a\u95f4\u6765\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u5076\u7136\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCDEC\u4e0eIDEC\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OoD\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316(UQ)\u662f\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b83\u6df1\u523b\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u51b3\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684UQ\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC \u548c IDEC)\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5206\u522b\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fe1\u5ea6\u96c6\uff08\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5408\u51f8\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc1\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u533a\u95f4\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100\u53ca\u5176\u81ea\u7136OoD\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eCDEC\u548cIDEC\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u603b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OoD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6269\u5c55\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8868\u660e\uff0cCDEC\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "CDEC\u548cIDEC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6587\u732e\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u8d85\u51fa\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6216\u5076\u7136\u6027\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Here we introduce $\\mathcal{IDK}$-$\\mathcal{S}$, a novel $\\mathbf{I}$ncremental $\\mathbf{D}$istributional $\\mathbf{K}$ernel for $\\mathbf{S}$treaming anomaly detection that effectively addresses these challenges by creating a new dynamic representation in the kernel mean embedding framework. The superiority of $\\mathcal{IDK}$-$\\mathcal{S}$ is attributed to two key innovations. First, it inherits the strengths of the Isolation Distributional Kernel, an offline detector that has demonstrated significant performance advantages over foundational methods like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor due to the use of a data-dependent kernel. Second, it adopts a lightweight incremental update mechanism that significantly reduces computational overhead compared to the naive baseline strategy of performing a full model retraining. This is achieved without compromising detection accuracy, a claim supported by its statistical equivalence to the full retrained model.

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape. We provide the first theoretical explanations for some empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption, dead neurons, and the neuron resampling technique. We further design controlled experiments to validate our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60(SDL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7b49\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u5c06SDL\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5438\u6536\u3001\u6b7b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u53ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u7b49\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u5982\u4f55\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u8fdb\u6b65\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u90e8\u7f72\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SDL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u8f6c\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684SDL\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6b63\u5f0f\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60(SDL)\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6210\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e9b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u7279\u5f81\u5438\u6536\u3001\u6b7b\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u4ee5\u53ca\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u7a00\u758f\u5b57\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u5206\u79bb\u53e0\u52a0\u6982\u5ff5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8be5\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process. They suffer from two key issues. First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \\textbf{S}pherical \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{N}eighborhoods \\textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u5f52\u6837\u6761\uff08MARS\uff09\u548cN-\u7403\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c1137%\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ed1\u76d2\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5f97\u5230\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684LIME\u6280\u672f\u5047\u8bbe\u5c40\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u5f52\u6837\u6761(MARS)\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u5e95\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528N-\u7403\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u671f\u671b\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u53d6\u6837\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u50cfLIME\u90a3\u6837\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2aUCI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u53ca\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6838\u5bbd\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8637%\u7684\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982LIME\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

Code available at: https://github.com/charliezchen/scaling-matrix-preconditioning", "summary": "Several recently introduced deep learning optimizers utilizing matrix-level preconditioning have shown promising speedups relative to the current dominant optimizer AdamW, particularly in relatively small-scale experiments. However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u6765\u6269\u5927\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8Muon\u548cShampoo\u7b49\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8eAdamW\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u6700\u8fd1\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u7ea7\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u4f18\u5316\u5668AdamW\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u590d\u5236\u7ed3\u679c\u5374\u53c2\u5dee\u4e0d\u9f50\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5305\u62ecShampoo\u3001SOAP\u548cMuon\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5e94\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u8bf8\u5982\u963b\u585e\uff08blocking\uff09\u548c\u5ac1\u63a5\uff08grafting\uff09\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u03bcP\u7b49\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u5584\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6839\u636e\u03bcP\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6539\u5584\u8f6c\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6709\u9650\u5bbd\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u6700\u4f18\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u963b\u585e\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c31\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5f97\u5230\u7f13\u89e3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u4f18\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u63091/width\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7f29\u653e\u51e0\u4e4e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u540e\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230Muon\u548cShampoo\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3Llama\u67b6\u6784\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4AdamW\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.4\u500d\u548c1.3\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6700\u4f18\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5b9e\u9645\u8c03\u4f18\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6bd4\u8f83\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5219\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u67d0\u4e9b\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5982Muon\u548cShampoo\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8eAdamW\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Such evaluations quantify how well a function behaves on a distribution, but they do not address whether the internal decomposition of a model is uniquely determined by the data and evaluation design. In this paper, we introduce \\emph{Modular Jets} for regression and classification pipelines. Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u55b7\u6d41\uff08Modular Jets\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u7684\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc1\u660e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MoJet\uff09\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ecf\u9a8c\u55b7\u6d41\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ba1\u9053\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u67d0\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u5426\u7531\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bbe\u8ba1\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u2018\u6a21\u5757\u55b7\u6d41\u2019\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c0f\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u5982\u4f55\u53cd\u5e94\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0a\u7684\u2018\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\u2019\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u591a\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u6301\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5bf9\u7684\u662f\u2018\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u2019\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u55b7\u6d41\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u552f\u4e00\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u55b7\u6d41\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u5b9a\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u7684\u79e9\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e14\u6709\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u56e0\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\uff1b\u800c\u4ec5\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5219\u5141\u8bb8\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u55b7\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6d77\u5e02\u8703\u697c\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08MoJet\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ba1\u9053\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6a21\u5757\u55b7\u6d41\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u3002"}}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU).

Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\\approx 0.3 \\%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11Transformer\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u52a0\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7b80\u5316Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u635f\u5931\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u8fbe10\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u81f3\u539f\u59cb\u7684\u7ea60.3%\u800c\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7535\u8def\u6d89\u53ca\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8fb9\u6570\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86100\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559Transformer\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u66b4\u9732\u66f4\u6709\u5e8f\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5f53\u524d\u8bb8\u591a\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u591a\u4f59\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u5bfc\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

MMAs that experience high speeds or high cycles require liquid based lubricants due to their ability to reflow to the point of contact.

This work introduces a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predicting vapor pressure, enabling virtual screening and discovery of new space-suitable liquid lubricants. The ML models are trained with data from both high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations and experimental databases.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u539f\u5219\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u7ecf\u6210\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u505a\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u53ef\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6700\u597d\u5730\u786e\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528\u54ea\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5f53\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u4e14\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6216\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u6982\u5ff5\u6d89\u53ca\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5141\u8bb8\u5b9a\u4e49\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5728ImageNet1K\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u5305\u62ecFood-101\u3001PlantNet-300K\u4ee5\u53caiNaturalist\u5728\u5185\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5730\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c55\u793a\u5176\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u539f\u5219\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u9762\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Yet, as sequence length and batch size grow, the cache becomes a major memory bottleneck. Prior compression methods typically apply low-rank decomposition to keys alone or attempt to jointly embed queries and keys, but both approaches neglect that attention fundamentally depends on their inner products. In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution. By targeting the true source of redundancy, KQ-SVD preserves attention outputs with higher fidelity under compression. Extensive evaluations on LLaMA and Mistral models demonstrate that our approach consistently delivers superior projection quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5KQ-SVD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u4f18\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u5185\u79ef\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LLaMA\u548cMistral\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u548c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5bf9\u952e\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u79ef\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KQ-SVD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c01\u95ed\u89e3\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u76f4\u63a5\u6267\u884c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ee5\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LLaMA\u548cMistral\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "KQ-SVD\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7279\u6027\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\uff08ABS\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u516c\u5171\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\uff08PUMS\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e2007\u5e74\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u8c03\u67e5\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u548c\u5927\u6570\u636e\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u533f\u540d\u5316\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u8fdd\u53cd\u5bf9\u8c03\u67e5\u53d7\u8bbf\u8005\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u627f\u8bfa\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u53c8\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4efb\u4f55\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2a\u4f53\u6216\u4f01\u4e1a\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e74\u5ea6\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5(ABS)\u7684\u5408\u6210PUMS\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u4e0eABS\u4e1a\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\u76842007\u5e74\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e3b\u8c03\u67e5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5408\u6210PUMS\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u8ba1\u91cf\u7ecf\u6d4e\u590d\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524dABS PUMS\u6b63\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u4e2d\u4e14\u7ed3\u679c\u4fdd\u5bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6210\u529f\u5730\u590d\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728ABS\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8eABS\u7b49\u5546\u4e1a\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers. We introduce MaxShapley, an efficient algorithm for fair attribution in generative search pipelines that use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMaxShapley\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6700\u5927\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786eShapley\u503c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5f52\u5c5e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\u9010\u6e10\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u7684\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u76f8\u5e94\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7ef4\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6839\u636e\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u5c5e\u548c\u8865\u507f\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MaxShapley\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u522b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684Shapley\u503c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u5927-\u603b\u548c\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f52\u5c5e\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a\u6587\u6863\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u975eShapley\u503c\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6210\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u591a\u8df3QA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cMaxShapley\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u51c6\u786eShapley\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5f52\u5c5e\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u540c\u5f52\u5c5e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e8\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MaxShapley\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5f52\u5c5e\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u786e\u4fdd\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u4f9b\u8005\u5f97\u5230\u9002\u5f53\u8865\u507f\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences.
