Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in
generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when
employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple
semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the
continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips,
resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these
challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the
Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module
(TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from
adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM
operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the
pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them
to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from
variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating
compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input
conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding
and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made
possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed
throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the
proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios. Codes are
available at https://github.com/asdryau/TransPhase.

Abstract: The demand for efficient multi-rate encoding techniques has surged with the
increasing prevalence of ultra-high-definition (UHD) video content,
particularly in adaptive streaming scenarios where a single video must be
encoded at multiple bitrates to accommodate diverse network conditions. While
Versatile Video Coding (VVC) significantly improves compression efficiency, it
introduces considerable computational complexity, making multi-rate encoding a
resource-intensive task. This paper examines coding unit (CU) partitioning
strategies to minimize redundant computations in VVC while preserving high
video quality. We propose single- and double-bound approaches, leveraging CU
depth constraints from reference encodes to guide dependent encodes across
multiple QPs. These methods are evaluated using VVenC with various presets,
demonstrating consistent improvements in encoding efficiency. Our methods
achieve up to 11.69 % reduction in encoding time with minimal bitrate overhead
(<0.6 %). Comparative Pareto-front (PF) analysis highlights the superior
performance of multi-rate approaches over existing configurations. These
findings validate the potential of CU-guided strategies for scalable multi-rate
encoding in adaptive streaming.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language
querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs)
with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via
text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted,
parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low
latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1)
whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial
data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock
ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for
end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices
and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show
look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs.
Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high
for S\&P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and
cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We
discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.

Abstract: In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval
stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to
a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from
outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests),
where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions
candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of
several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach
that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual
encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and
content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline,
including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at
LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online
serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the
prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding,
facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The
system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed
substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains
among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that
high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how
generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high
throughput retrieval in industrial applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into recommendation systems
has revealed promising potential through their capacity to extract world
knowledge for enhanced reasoning capabilities. However, current methodologies
that adopt static schema-based prompting mechanisms encounter significant
limitations: (1) they employ universal template structures that neglect the
multi-faceted nature of user preference diversity; (2) they implement
superficial alignment between semantic knowledge representations and behavioral
feature spaces without achieving comprehensive latent space integration. To
address these challenges, we introduce CoCo, an end-to-end framework that
dynamically constructs user-specific contextual knowledge embeddings through a
dual-mechanism approach. Our method realizes profound integration of semantic
and behavioral latent dimensions via adaptive knowledge fusion and
contradiction resolution modules. Experimental evaluations across diverse
benchmark datasets and an enterprise-level e-commerce platform demonstrate
CoCo's superiority, achieving a maximum 8.58% improvement over seven
cutting-edge methods in recommendation accuracy. The framework's deployment on
a production advertising system resulted in a 1.91% sales growth, validating
its practical effectiveness. With its modular design and model-agnostic
architecture, CoCo provides a versatile solution for next-generation
recommendation systems requiring both knowledge-enhanced reasoning and
personalized adaptation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In modern e-commerce search systems, dense retrieval has become an
indispensable component. By computing similarities between query and item
(product) embeddings, it efficiently selects candidate products from
large-scale repositories. With the breakthroughs in large language models
(LLMs), mainstream embedding models have gradually shifted from BERT to LLMs
for more accurate text modeling. However, these models still adopt
direct-embedding methods, and the semantic accuracy of embeddings remains
inadequate. Therefore, contrastive learning is heavily employed to achieve
tight semantic alignment between positive pairs. Consequently, such models tend
to capture statistical co-occurrence patterns in the training data, biasing
them toward shallow lexical and semantic matches. For difficult queries
exhibiting notable lexical disparity from target items, the performance
degrades significantly. In this work, we propose the Large Reasoning Embedding
Model (LREM), which novelly integrates reasoning processes into representation
learning. For difficult queries, LREM first conducts reasoning to achieve a
deep understanding of the original query, and then produces a
reasoning-augmented query embedding for retrieval. This reasoning process
effectively bridges the semantic gap between original queries and target items,
significantly improving retrieval accuracy. Specifically, we adopt a two-stage
training process: the first stage optimizes the LLM on carefully curated
Query-CoT-Item triplets with SFT and InfoNCE losses to establish preliminary
reasoning and embedding capabilities, and the second stage further refines the
reasoning trajectories via reinforcement learning (RL). Extensive offline and
online experiments validate the effectiveness of LREM, leading to its
deployment on China's largest e-commerce platform since August 2025.

Abstract: This paper presents the 5th place solution by our team, y3h2, for the Meta
CRAG-MM Challenge at KDD Cup 2025. The CRAG-MM benchmark is a visual question
answering (VQA) dataset focused on factual questions about images, including
egocentric images. The competition was contested based on VQA accuracy, as
judged by an LLM-based automatic evaluator. Since incorrect answers result in
negative scores, our strategy focused on reducing hallucinations from the
internal representations of the VLM. Specifically, we trained logistic
regression-based hallucination detection models using both the hidden_state and
the outputs of specific attention heads. We then employed an ensemble of these
models. As a result, while our method sacrificed some correct answers, it
significantly reduced hallucinations and allowed us to place among the top
entries on the final leaderboard. For implementation details and code, please

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial
retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple
user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user
interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations:
the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The
second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to
capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin
with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then,
we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we
propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named
GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a
structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving
dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest
Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest
dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a
generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c)
Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple
user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well
as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness.
Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its
practical value in industrial applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces
key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning,
especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by
limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to
capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation
contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework
that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve
personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to
enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy
between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional
query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval.
Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to
autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and
reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive
reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly
personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics,
validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized
recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation
systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or
features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating
inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain
modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features
without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their
contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a
cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to
target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying
unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In
this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a
causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate
the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We
then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive
a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the
biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an
enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model
to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses,
as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness
of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover,
it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical
value in real-world applications.

Abstract: Offline evaluations in recommender system research depend heavily on
datasets, many of which are pruned, such as the widely used MovieLens
collections. This thesis examines the impact of data pruning - specifically,
removing users with fewer than a specified number of interactions - on both
dataset characteristics and algorithm performance. Five benchmark datasets were
analysed in both their unpruned form and at five successive pruning levels (5,
10, 20, 50, 100). For each coreset, we examined structural and distributional
characteristics and trained and tested eleven representative algorithms. To
further assess if pruned datasets lead to artificially inflated performance
results, we also evaluated models trained on the pruned train sets but tested
on unpruned data. Results show that commonly applied core pruning can be highly
selective, leaving as little as 2% of the original users in some datasets.
Traditional algorithms achieved higher nDCG@10 scores when both training and
testing on pruned data; however, this advantage largely disappeared when
evaluated on unpruned test sets. Across all algorithms, performance declined
with increasing pruning levels when tested on unpruned data, highlighting the
impact of dataset reduction on the performance of recommender algorithms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: User interests on content platforms are inherently diverse, manifesting
through complex behavioral patterns across heterogeneous scenarios such as
search, feed browsing, and content discovery. Traditional recommendation
systems typically prioritize business metric optimization within isolated
specific scenarios, neglecting cross-scenario behavioral signals and struggling
to integrate advanced techniques like LLMs at billion-scale deployments, which
finally limits their ability to capture holistic user interests across platform
touchpoints. We propose RED-Rec, an LLM-enhanced hierarchical Recommender
Engine for Diversified scenarios, tailored for industry-level content
recommendation systems. RED-Rec unifies user interest representations across
multiple behavioral contexts by aggregating and synthesizing actions from
varied scenarios, resulting in comprehensive item and user modeling. At its
core, a two-tower LLM-powered framework enables nuanced, multifaceted
representations with deployment efficiency, and a scenario-aware dense mixing
and querying policy effectively fuses diverse behavioral signals to capture
cross-scenario user intent patterns and express fine-grained, context-specific
intents during serving. We validate RED-Rec through online A/B testing on
hundreds of millions of users in RedNote through online A/B testing, showing
substantial performance gains in both content recommendation and advertisement
targeting tasks. We further introduce a million-scale sequential recommendation
dataset, RED-MMU, for comprehensive offline training and evaluation. Our work
advances unified user modeling, unlocking deeper personalization and fostering
more meaningful user engagement in large-scale UGC platforms.

Abstract: Recommender systems continuously interact with users, creating feedback loops
that shape both individual behavior and collective market dynamics. This paper
introduces a simulation framework to model these loops in online retail
environments, where recommenders are periodically retrained on evolving
user-item interactions. Using the Amazon e-Commerce dataset, we analyze how
different recommendation algorithms influence diversity, purchase
concentration, and user homogenization over time. Results reveal a systematic
trade-off: while the feedback loop increases individual diversity, it
simultaneously reduces collective diversity and concentrates demand on a few
popular items. Moreover, for some recommender systems, the feedback loop
increases user homogenization over time, making user purchase profiles
increasingly similar. These findings underscore the need for recommender
designs that balance personalization with long-term diversity.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 models, at two different
parameter counts: 17M and 32M. As part of our research, we conduct numerous
experiments to improve retrieval and late-interaction models, which we intend
to distill into smaller models as proof-of-concepts. Our ultimate aim is to
support retrieval at all scales, from large-scale retrieval which lives in the
cloud to models that can run locally, on any device. mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a
model that we hope will serve as a solid foundation backbone for all future
experiments, representing the first version of a long series of small
proof-of-concepts. As part of the development of mxbai-edge-colbert-v0, we
conducted multiple ablation studies, of which we report the results. In terms
of downstream performance, mxbai-edge-colbert-v0 is a particularly capable
small model, outperforming ColBERTv2 on common short-text benchmarks (BEIR) and
representing a large step forward in long-context tasks, with unprecedented
efficiency.
