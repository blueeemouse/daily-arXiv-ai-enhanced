Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by
enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through
conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains
challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) systems have traditionally relied on structured text
data, but the rapid growth of multimedia content (images, audio, video, and
structured metadata) has introduced new challenges and opportunities for
retrieval-augmented QA. In this survey, we review recent advancements in QA
systems that integrate multimedia retrieval pipelines, focusing on
architectures that align vision, language, and audio modalities with user
queries. We categorize approaches based on retrieval methods, fusion
techniques, and answer generation strategies, and analyze benchmark datasets,
evaluation protocols, and performance tradeoffs. Furthermore, we highlight key
challenges such as cross-modal alignment, latency-accuracy tradeoffs, and
semantic grounding, and outline open problems and future research directions
for building more robust and context-aware QA systems leveraging multimedia
data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their
advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of
user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial
fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to
capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This
paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing
on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a
case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across
dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid
update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic
fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B
experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields
statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a
practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered
recommender systems.

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes
structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike
past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and
streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries
between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming
systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle
the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based
Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative
workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for
iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular
components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer
event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework
reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media
Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where
music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive
ecosystem.

Abstract: Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models,
predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their
effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event
occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock
time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative
attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if
designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal
and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in
LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires
incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose
Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs
that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry
directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and
split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a
proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve
accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results
position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly
foundation for generative recommendation.

Abstract: This study presents the multilingual e-commerce search system developed by
the Tredence_AICOE team. The competition features two multilingual relevance
tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual
product listing. To ensure full language coverage, we performed data
augmentation by translating existing datasets into languages missing from the
development set, enabling training across all target languages. We fine-tuned
Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original
and translated data, and the best QI performance using original, translated,
and minority class data creation. These approaches secured 4th place on the
final leaderboard, with an average F1-score of 0.8857 on the private test set.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large
language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as
generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic
modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,
combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents
significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting
pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction
manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that
integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses
heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete
item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic
representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,
which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and
a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent
preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised
sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization
(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward
and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end
optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively
supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for
high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning
Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal
transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over
strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM
recommenders.
