Abstract: Recommender systems in multi-behavior domains, such as advertising and
e-commerce, aim to guide users toward high-value but inherently sparse
conversions. Leveraging auxiliary behaviors (e.g., clicks, likes, shares) is
therefore essential. Recent progress on generative recommendations has brought
new possibilities for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. However,
existing generative approaches face two significant challenges: 1) Inadequate
Sequence Modeling: capture the complex, cross-level dependencies within user
behavior sequences, and 2) Lack of Suitable Datasets: publicly available
multi-behavior recommendation datasets are almost exclusively derived from
e-commerce platforms, limiting the validation of feasibility in other domains,
while also lacking sufficient side information for semantic ID generation. To
address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework, GAMER
(Generative Augmentation and Multi-lEvel behavior modeling for Recommendation),
built upon a decoder-only backbone. GAMER introduces a cross-level interaction
layer to capture hierarchical dependencies among behaviors and a sequential
augmentation strategy that enhances robustness in training. To further advance
this direction, we collect and release ShortVideoAD, a large-scale
multi-behavior dataset from a mainstream short-video platform, which differs
fundamentally from existing e-commerce datasets and provides pretrained
semantic IDs for research on generative methods. Extensive experiments show
that GAMER consistently outperforms both discriminative and generative
baselines across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a cornerstone algorithm for
information retrieval, recommendation systems, and machine learning
applications. While x86-based architectures have historically dominated this
domain, the increasing adoption of ARM-based servers in industry presents a
critical need for ANNS solutions optimized on ARM architectures. A naive port
of existing x86 ANNS algorithms to ARM platforms results in a substantial
performance deficit, failing to leverage the unique capabilities of the
underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we introduce KScaNN, a novel
ANNS algorithm co-designed for the Kunpeng 920 ARM architecture. KScaNN
embodies a holistic approach that synergizes sophisticated, data aware
algorithmic refinements with carefully-designed hardware specific
optimizations. Its core contributions include: 1) novel algorithmic techniques,
including a hybrid intra-cluster search strategy and an improved PQ residual
calculation method, which optimize the search process at a higher level; 2) an
ML-driven adaptive search module that provides adaptive, per-query tuning of
search parameters, eliminating the inefficiencies of static configurations; and
3) highly-optimized SIMD kernels for ARM that maximize hardware utilization for
the critical distance computation workloads. The experimental results
demonstrate that KScaNN not only closes the performance gap but establishes a
new standard, achieving up to a 1.63x speedup over the fastest x86-based
solution. This work provides a definitive blueprint for achieving
leadership-class performance for vector search on modern ARM architectures and

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid growth of open-access (OA) publications has intensified the
challenge of identifying relevant scientific papers. Due to privacy constraints
and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward
content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information.
However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text,
neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic
completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose
OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective,
Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning,
and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style
summarization module converts raw papers into structured and
discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives
align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels.
The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through
contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly
constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in
Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that
QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete
representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable
content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing
trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.

Abstract: The Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) is a novel meta-model aimed at providing
a common ground for process data records centered around events and objects.
One of its objectives is to foster interoperability and process information
exchange. In this context, the integration of data from different providers,
the combination of multiple processes, and the enhancement of knowledge
inference are novel challenges. Semantic Web technologies can enable the
creation of a machine-readable OCED description enriched through ontology-based
relationships and entity categorization. In this paper, we introduce an
approach built upon Semantic Web technologies for the realization of
semantic-enhanced OCED, with the aim to strengthen process data reasoning,
interconnect information sources, and boost expressiveness.

Abstract: CLAX is a JAX-based library that implements classic click models using modern
gradient-based optimization. While neural click models have emerged over the
past decade, complex click models based on probabilistic graphical models
(PGMs) have not systematically adopted gradient-based optimization, preventing
practitioners from leveraging modern deep learning frameworks while preserving
the interpretability of classic models. CLAX addresses this gap by replacing
EM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically
stable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any
component, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic
click models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by
running experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion
user sessions in $\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster
than traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models,
serving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and
improve ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click
models. CLAX is available at: https://github.com/philipphager/clax
