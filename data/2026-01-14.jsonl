The framework is centered on the core idea that ad narratives are structured by functional intent, with each scene unit performing a distinct communicative function, delivering product and brand-oriented information within seconds. MLLM-VADStory segments ads into functional units, classifies each unit's functionality using a novel advertising-specific functional role taxonomy, and then aggregates functional sequences across ads to recover data-driven storyline structures. Applying the framework to 50k social media video ads across four industry subverticals, we find that story-based creatives improve video retention, and we recommend top-performing story arcs to guide advertisers in creative design. Our framework demonstrates the value of using domain knowledge to guide MLLMs in generating scalable insights for video ad storylines, making it a versatile tool for understanding video creatives in general."}

Existing benchmarks for evaluating AFC systems, however, are largely limited in terms of task scope, modalities, domain, language diversity, realism, or coverage of misinformation types. Critically, they are static, thus subject to data leakage as their claims enter the pretraining corpora of LLMs. As a result, benchmark performance no longer reliably reflects the actual ability to verify claims. We introduce Verified Theses and Statements (VeriTaS), the first dynamic benchmark for multimodal AFC, designed to remain robust under ongoing large-scale pretraining of foundation models. VeriTaS currently comprises 24,000 real-world claims from 108 professional fact-checking organizations across 54 languages, covering textual and audiovisual content. Claims are added quarterly via a fully automated seven-stage pipeline that normalizes claim formulation, retrieves original media, and maps heterogeneous expert verdicts to a novel, standardized, and disentangled scoring scheme with textual justifications. Through human evaluation, we demonstrate that the automated annotations closely match human judgments. We commit to update VeriTaS in the future, establishing a leakage-resistant benchmark, supporting meaningful AFC evaluation in the era of rapidly evolving foundation models. We will make the code and data publicly available."}

A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science."}

A Pareto-Front Analysis of DNN Partitioning for Edge Inference", "comment": null, "summary": "The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained edge devices is frequently hindered by their significant computational and memory requirements. While partitioning and distributing a DNN across multiple devices is a well-established strategy to mitigate this challenge, prior research has largely focused on single-objective optimization, such as minimizing latency or maximizing throughput. This paper challenges that view by reframing DNN partitioning as a multi-objective optimization problem. We argue that in real-world scenarios, a complex trade-off between latency and throughput exists, which is further complicated by network variability. To address this, we introduce ParetoPipe, an open-source framework that leverages Pareto front analysis to systematically identify optimal partitioning strategies that balance these competing objectives.\n  Our contributions are threefold: we benchmark pipeline partitioned inference on a heterogeneous testbed of Raspberry Pis and a GPU-equipped edge server; we identify Pareto-optimal points to analyze the latency-throughput trade-off under varying network conditions; and we release a flexible, open-source framework to facilitate distributed inference and benchmarking. This toolchain features dual communication backends, PyTorch RPC and a custom lightweight implementation, to minimize overhead and support broad experimentation."}

Code can be found at: https://github.com/glam-imperial/AffectEffect", "summary": "Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification."}

In this paper, we present SVFusion, a GPU-CPU-disk collaborative framework for real-time vector search that bridges sophisticated GPU computation with online updates. SVFusion leverages a hierarchical vector index architecture that employs CPU-GPU co-processing, along with a workload-aware vector caching mechanism to maximize the efficiency of limited GPU memory. It further enhances performance through real-time coordination with CUDA multi-stream optimization and adaptive resource management, along with concurrency control that ensures data consistency under interleaved queries and updates.

Current approaches to mitigate these risks, such as model-based safeguards, enhance agents' reliability but cannot guarantee system safety. Methods like information flow control (IFC) and temporal constraints aim to provide guarantees but often require extensive human annotation. We propose a process that starts with applying System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) to identify hazards in agent workflows, derive safety requirements, and formalize them as enforceable specifications on data flows and tool sequences. To enable this, we introduce a capability-enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework that requires structured labels on capabilities, confidentiality, and trust level. Together, these contributions aim to shift LLM-based agent safety from ad hoc reliability fixes to proactive guardrails with formal guarantees, while reducing dependence on user confirmation and making autonomy a deliberate design choice."}

These workloads often rely on Cholesky (POTRF) decomposition and its supporting operations, triangular solves (TRSM) and symmetric rank-k updates (SYRK), which together form the computational core for solving symmetric positive-definite systems. To accelerate these kernels, we present a portable, mixed-precision solver designed for Matrix Processing Units (MXUs), including NVIDIA Tensor Cores (H200) and AMD Matrix Cores (MI300X). Our algorithm builds on a nested recursive formulation in which Cholesky exposes parallelism through recursive decomposition of its TRSM and SYRK sub-problems. This structure yields a hierarchical recursion that maximizes GEMM throughput while enabling fine-grained control over numerical precision. We introduce a custom recursive data structure that assigns low-precision FP16 arithmetic to large off-diagonal blocks, while preserving high precision on diagonal blocks to ensure numerical stability. The solver is implemented in Julia, leveraging array programming, multiple dispatch, and dynamic type inference to enable seamless expression of mixed-precision computation. This design provides a high-level, hardware-agnostic interface while efficiently interfacing with low-level vendor libraries for backend portability. On H200, our recursive FP64 SYRK achieves a 14x speedup over cuBLAS, while mixed-precision delivers up to 27x speedup in SYRK and 5x in TRSM over full-precision baselines. This results in a 5x overall speedup for Cholesky versus cuSOLVER FP64, with 100x better accuracy than pure FP16 while retaining 88% of its peak speedup. Comparable performance and accuracy trends are observed on MI300X, demonstrating broad applicability across GPUs."}

While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training. We evaluate RewriteNets on algorithmic, compositional, and string manipulation tasks, comparing them against strong LSTM and Transformer baselines. Results show that RewriteNets excel at tasks requiring systematic generalization (achieving 98.7% accuracy on the SCAN benchmark's length split) and are computationally more efficient than Transformers.

Meanwhile, we designed two specific components to handle LLM hallucination and redundancy in generated content. We evaluated AutoDoc against five comparison baselines on 48 APIs of different popularity levels. Our results indicate that the API documents generated by AutoDoc are up to 77.7% more accurate, 9.5% less duplicated, and contain 34.4% knowledge uncovered by the official documents. We also measured the sensitivity of AutoDoc to the choice of different LLMs. We found that while larger LLMs produce higher-quality API documents, AutoDoc enables smaller open-source models (e.g., Mistral-7B-v0.3) to achieve comparable results. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the API documents generated by AutoDoc. All participants found API documents generated by AutoDoc to be more comprehensive, concise, and helpful than the comparison baselines.

We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE.

How do cognitive biases manifest and impact decision-making in emerging AI-collaborative development? This paper presents the first comprehensive study of cognitive biases in LLM-assisted development. We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining observational studies with 14 student and professional developers, followed by surveys with 22 additional developers. We qualitatively compare categories of biases affecting developers against the traditional non-LLM workflows. Our findings suggest that LLM-related actions are more likely to be associated with novel biases. Through a systematic analysis of 90 cognitive biases specific to developer-LLM interactions, we develop a taxonomy of 15 bias categories validated by cognitive psychologists. We found that 48.8% of total programmer actions are biased, and developer-LLM interactions account for 56.4% of these biased actions. We discuss how these bias categories manifest, present tools and practices for developers, and recommendations for LLM tool builders to help mitigate cognitive biases in human-AI programming."}

This counterintuitive success stems from the observation of the `Markovian' nature: advanced sequential recommenders coincidentally rely on the latest interaction to make predictions, while the historical interactions serve mainly as auxiliary cues for inferring the user's general, non-sequential identity. This characteristic necessitates the capabilities of a universal recommendation model to effectively summarize the user sequence, with particular emphasis on the latest interaction. MPT inherently has the potential to be universal and transferable. On the one hand, when trained to predict the next state of Markov chains, it acquires the capabilities to estimate transition probabilities from the context (one adaptive manner for summarizing sequences) and attend to the last state to ensure accurate state transitions. On the other hand, unlike the heterogeneous interaction data, an unlimited amount of controllable Markov chains is available to boost the model capacity. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets from three distinct platforms to validate the superiority of Markovian pre-training over traditional recommendation pre-training and recent language pre-training paradigms."}

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

Roads are finally prioritized based on geometric complexity, driving difficulty, and historical failures, ensuring that the most critical and challenging tests are executed first. We evaluate our framework on the OPENCAT dataset and the Udacity self-driving car simulator using two ADAS models.

However, due to memory constraints, MoE models with billions or even trillions of parameters can only be deployed in multi-GPU or even multi-node & multi-GPU based serving systems. Thus, communication has became a major bottleneck in distributed serving systems, especially inter-node communication. Contemporary distributed MoE models are primarily implemented using all-reduce (AR) based tensor parallelism (TP) and all-to-all (A2A) based expert parallelism (EP). However, TP generally exhibits low inter-node efficiency and is thus confined to high-speed intra-node bandwidth. In contrast, EP tends to suffer from load imbalance, especially when the parallel degree is high.\n  In this work, we introduce MixServe, a novel automatic distributed serving system for efficient deployment of MoE models by a novel TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm. MixServe begins by evaluating the communication overhead associated with various parallel strategies, taking into account the model hyperparameters and the configurations of network and hardware resources, and then automatically selects the most efficient parallel strategy. Then, we propose the TP-EP hybrid parallelism based on fused AR-A2A communication algorithm that overlaps intra-node AR communication and inter-node A2A communication. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 models demonstrate that MixServe achieves superior inference performance, with 1.08~3.80x acceleration in time to first token (TTFT), 1.03~1.66x acceleration in inter-token latency (ITL), and 5.2%~50.3% throughput improvement compared to existing approaches."}

The optimizer employs custom CUDA kernels that deliver substantial speedups (3-5 for critical operations) while preserving numerical stability under standard stochastic-optimization assumptions. We provide fully developed mathematical formulations for rectified adaptive learning rates, a memory-efficient lookahead mechanism that reduces overhead from O(2p) to O(p + p/k), and the synergistic coupling of complementary optimization components. Theoretical analysis establishes convergence guarantees and elucidates the stability and variance-reduction properties of the method. Extensive empirical evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and ImageNette demonstrates NOVAK superiority over 14 contemporary optimizers, including Adam, AdamW, RAdam, Lion, and Adan. Across architectures such as ResNet-50, VGG-16, and ViT, NOVAK consistently achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and exceptional robustness, attaining very high accuracy on VGG-16/ImageNette demonstrating superior architectural robustness compared to contemporary optimizers.

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality.

Interestingly, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enables the development of tools based on conversational interfaces that can assist operators in their retrieval tasks, improving their capability to respond to incidents. This paper presents the results of a set of experiments that derive from the analysis of the troubleshooting procedures available in Fincantieri, a large international company developing complex naval cyber-physical systems.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B. TesseraQ's accuracy degradation is recovered by 3.63-7.63% in relative terms when augmented by our proposed loss function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that distributional alignment provides a simple yet effective performance boost that can push the limits of frontier quantization methods. Our method is available on GitHub to facilitate future progress in ultra-low-bit quantization."}

PosIR comprises 310 datasets spanning 10 languages and 31 domains, constructed through a rigorous pipeline that ties relevance to precise reference spans, enabling the strict disentanglement of document length from information position. Extensive experiments with 10 state-of-the-art embedding models reveal that: (1) Performance on PosIR in long-context settings correlates poorly with the MMTEB benchmark, exposing limitations in current short-text benchmarks; (2) Position bias is pervasive and intensifies with document length, with most models exhibiting primacy bias while certain models show unexpected recency bias; (3) Gradient-based saliency analysis further uncovers the distinct internal attention mechanisms driving these positional preferences.

DKB builds its graph in seconds, while LLM-KB requires much longer graph generation. LLM-KB also shows indexing incompleteness: on Shopizer, 377 files are skipped or missed, reducing embedded chunk coverage and graph size compared to DKB. End-to-end cost is modest for DKB relative to the vector-only baseline but much higher for LLM-KB, especially as repository scale increases.

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."}

Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL.

In this work, we seek to advance the state of the art by developing a novel two-stage transformer model for functional group removal and replacement. Unlike one-shot approaches that generate entire molecules in a single pass, our method generates the functional group to be removed and appended sequentially, ensuring strict substructure-level modifications.

In this paper, we propose Med-MoE-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to enable efficient multi-task domain adaptation, especially for medical scenarios. Drawing inspiration from recent advances, our framework employs an asymmetric expert distribution where deeper layers are equipped with a higher density of LoRA experts to capture complex semantic abstractions. We further introduce a \"Knowledge-Preservation Plugin\", inspired by LoRA MoE, to isolate and protect general-purpose reasoning. By utilizing soft merging with adaptive routing and rank-wise decoupling, Med-MoE-LoRA achieves superior performance in medical benchmarks while reducing interference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms standard LoRA and conventional MoE architectures across multiple clinical NLP tasks while retaining the model's general cognitive capabilities."}

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields."}

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy."}

Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap.

Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $ε$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $ε$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting.

To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold.

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL."}

Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere.

Traditional approaches--independent training and multi-task learning--struggle with either excessive computational costs or negative transfer. A recently proposed multi-policy approach, Model-Based Transfer Learning (MBTL), has demonstrated effectiveness by strategically selecting a few tasks to train and zero-shot transfer. However, CMDPs encompass a wide range of problems, exhibiting structural properties that vary from problem to problem. As such, different task selection strategies are suitable for different CMDPs. In this work, we introduce Structure Detection MBTL (SD-MBTL), a generic framework that dynamically identifies the underlying generalization structure of CMDP and selects an appropriate MBTL algorithm. For instance, we observe Mountain structure in which generalization performance degrades from the training performance of the target task as the context difference increases. We thus propose M/GP-MBTL, which detects the structure and adaptively switches between a Gaussian Process-based approach and a clustering-based approach. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and CRL benchmarks--covering continuous control, traffic control, and agricultural management--show that M/GP-MBTL surpasses the strongest prior method by 12.49% on the aggregated metric.

Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates.

Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks."}

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines."}

To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models.

We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure."}

We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix.

They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs.

In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions.

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance."}

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent."}

Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings."}

Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity."}

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage.

Although RL agents can converge to optimal solutions, the definition of ``optimality'' depends on the environment's statistical properties. The Bellman equation, central to most RL algorithms, is formulated in terms of expected values of future rewards. However, when ergodicity is broken, long-term outcomes depend on the specific trajectory rather than on the ensemble average. In such settings, the ensemble average diverges from the time-average growth experienced by individual agents, with expected-value formulations yielding systematically suboptimal policies. Prior studies demonstrated that traditional RL architectures fail to recover the true optimum in non-ergodic environments. We extend this analysis to deep RL implementations and show that these, too, produce suboptimal policies under non-ergodic dynamics. Introducing explicit time dependence into the learning process can correct this limitation. By allowing the network's function approximation to incorporate temporal information, the agent can estimate value functions consistent with the process's intrinsic growth rate. This improvement does not require altering the environmental feedback, such as reward transformations or modified objective functions, but arises naturally from the agent's exposure to temporal trajectories. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on reinforcement learning methods for non-ergodic systems."}

However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems."}

Clients request content through ANs acting as gateways, without observing AN states or the actions of other clients. We define the reward as the age of information reduction resulting from a client's selection of an AN, and formulate the problem as a non-stationary multi-armed bandit. In this decentralized and partially observable setting, the resulting reward process is history-dependent and coupled across clients, and exhibits both abrupt and gradual changes in expected rewards, rendering classical bandit-based approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose the AGING BANDIT WITH ADAPTIVE RESET algorithm, which combines adaptive windowing with periodic monitoring to track evolving reward distributions. We establish theoretical performance guarantees showing that the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal performance, and we validate the theoretical results through simulations."}

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones. Across mathematics, physics, and medical reasoning benchmarks, our approach consistently improves pass@$k$ across large sampling budgets and increases the area under the pass@$k$ curve (AUC@$K$) without sacrificing pass@1, while sustaining exploration and uncovering more diverse solution strategies at scale."}

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment. Finally, we provide theoretical convergence guarantees for self-play learning dynamics in these games and extend the framework to opponents that also generate multiple responses."}

In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto distance. Instead of principal components, we use an appropriate norm of the data vectors as the sorting criterion, combined with the triangle inequality for search termination. In the case of Tanimoto distance, a provably sharper intersection inequality is used to further boost the performance of the new algorithm. On a real-world chemical fingerprint benchmark, CLASSIX Tanimoto is about 30 times faster than the Taylor--Butina algorithm, and about 80 times faster than DBSCAN, while computing higher-quality clusters in both cases."}

A CDB differs from a traditional DB: it is designed to answer \"why'' questions via causal interventions and structured causal queries. CSQL builds on our earlier system, DEMOCRITUS, which converts documents into thousands of local causal models derived from causal discourse. Unlike RAG-based systems or knowledge-graph based approaches, CSQL supports causal analysis over document collections rather than purely associative retrieval. For example, given an article on the origins of human bipedal walking, CSQL enables queries such as: \"What are the strongest causal influences on bipedalism?'' or \"Which variables act as causal hubs with the largest downstream influence?'' Beyond single-document case studies, we show that CSQL can also ingest RAG/IE-compiled causal corpora at scale by compiling the Testing Causal Claims (TCC) dataset of economics papers into a causal database containing 265,656 claim instances spanning 45,319 papers, 44 years, and 1,575 reported method strings, thereby enabling corpus-level causal queries and longitudinal analyses in CSQL. Viewed abstractly, CSQL functions as a compiler from unstructured documents into a causal database equipped with a principled algebra of queries, and can be applied broadly across many domains ranging from business, humanities, and science."}

However, there is still no consensus on how best to construct and utilize such profiles. To address this, we revisit recent profiling-based approaches in recommender systems along four dimensions: 1) knowledge base, 2) preference indicator, 3) impact range, and 4) subject. We argue that large language models (LLMs) are effective at extracting compressed rationales from diverse knowledge sources, while knowledge graphs (KGs) are better suited for propagating these profiles to extend their reach. Building on this insight, we propose a new recommendation model, called SPiKE. SPiKE consists of three core components: i) Entity profile generation, which uses LLMs to generate semantic profiles for all KG entities; ii) Profile-aware KG aggregation, which integrates these profiles into the KG; and iii) Pairwise profile preference matching, which aligns LLM- and KG-based representations during training. In experiments, we demonstrate that SPiKE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art KG- and LLM-based recommenders in real-world settings."}

Leveraging BERTopic, we extract semantically coherent topics. Each topic is converted into a structured prompt, enabling a language model to generate meaningful topic labels and summaries in a zero-shot manner. Querying and document exploration are supported via dense embeddings and vector search, while a dedicated evaluation module assesses topical coherence and bias. This framework supports scalable and interpretable information access in specialized domains where labeled data is limited."}

These models often suffer from poor interpretability and no scale calibration, particularly when trained with typical ranking loss functions. This paper addresses the problem of post-hoc calibration of ranking models. We introduce MLPlatt: a simple yet effective ranking model calibration method that preserves the item ordering and converts ranker outputs to interpretable click-through rate (CTR) probabilities usable in downstream tasks. The method is context-aware by design and achieves good calibration metrics globally, and within strata corresponding to different values of a selected categorical field (such as user country or device), which is often important from a business perspective of an E-commerce platform. We demonstrate the superiority of MLPlatt over existing approaches on two datasets, achieving an improvement of over 10\\% in F-ECE (Field Expected Calibration Error) compared to other methods. Most importantly, we show that high-quality calibration can be achieved without compromising the ranking quality."}

We propose a multi-channel recommendation model, including a knowledge graph channel, a session hypergraph channel, and a session line graph channel, to capture information from multiple sources. Our model adaptively removes redundant edges in the knowledge graph channel to reduce noise. Knowledge graph representations cooperate with hypergraph representations for prediction to alleviate item dominance. We also generate in-session attention for denoising. Finally, we maximize mutual information between the hypergraph and line graph channels as an auxiliary task.

While existing methods attempt to fuse these heterogeneous signals, they inherently lack a principled mechanism to ensure robustness against such behavioral inconsistency.\n  In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Behavior Recommendation towards Target Behaviors (RMBRec), a robust multi-behavior recommendation framework grounded in an information-theoretic robustness principle. We interpret robustness as a joint process of maximizing predictive information while minimizing its variance across heterogeneous behavioral environments. Under this perspective, the Representation Robustness Module (RRM) enhances local semantic consistency by maximizing the mutual information between users' auxiliary and target representations, whereas the Optimization Robustness Module (ORM) enforces global stability by minimizing the variance of predictive risks across behaviors, which is an efficient approximation to invariant risk minimization. This local-global collaboration bridges representation purification and optimization invariance in a theoretically coherent way. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that RMBRec not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy but also maintains remarkable stability under various noise perturbations.
