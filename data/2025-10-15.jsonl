Embedding-based approaches like CLIP enable efficient\nlarge-scale retrieval via vector similarity search, but they are primarily\ntrained on literal caption-like text--image pairs and often fail to capture\nabstract or persona-driven attributes common in product recommendation\napplications (e.g., ``a gift for a mother who loves gardening''). In contrast,\nstate-of-the-art vision--language models (vLLMs) can align text with images in\na flexible manner, but their limited context window prevents them from directly\nhandling retrieval over large catalogs. We propose a framework that distills\nthe preference rankings of a powerful vLLM into an embedding-based system,\ntransferring its nuanced alignment abilities while maintaining the\ninference-time scalability of an embedding-based approach. Experiments on\npersona-driven product recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms existing embedding-based baselines, providing an\nefficient solution for personalized text--image retrieval."}

However, these methods often overlook the asymmetric academic\ninfluence that is prevalent in scholarly networks when learning graph\nrepresentations. To address this limitation, this study proposes the\nMutual-Influence-Aware Recommendation (MIARec) model, which employs a\ngravity-based approach to measure the mutual academic influence between\nscholars and incorporates this influence into the feature aggregation process\nduring message propagation in graph representation learning. Additionally, the\nmodel utilizes a multi-channel aggregation method to capture both individual\nembeddings of distinct single relational sub-networks and their interdependent\nembeddings, thereby enabling a more comprehensive understanding of the\nheterogeneous scholarly network.

Yet current generative recommenders still suffer from\ntwo core limitations: the lack of high-quality negative modeling and the\nreliance on implicit rewards. Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) offers a natural solution by enabling on-policy sampling of harder\nnegatives and grounding optimization in explicit reward signals. However,\napplying RLVR to generative recommenders remains non-trivial. Its unique\ngeneration space often leads to invalid or repetitive items that undermine\nsampling efficiency, and ranking supervision is sparse since most items receive\nidentical zero rewards. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforced\nPreference Optimization for Recommendation (ReRe), a reinforcement-based\nparadigm tailored to LLM-based recommenders, an important direction in\ngenerative recommendation. ReRe incorporates constrained beam search to improve\nsampling efficiency and diversify hard negatives, while augmenting rule-based\naccuracy rewards with auxiliary ranking rewards for finer-grained supervision.\nExtensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that ReRe\nconsistently outperforms both traditional and LLM-based recommenders in ranking\nperformance. Further analysis shows that ReRe not only enhances performance\nacross both base and SFT-initialized models but also generalizes robustly\nacross different backbone families and scales.
