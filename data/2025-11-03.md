Abstract: Multimodal retrieval systems are expected to operate in a semantic space,
agnostic to the language or cultural origin of the query. In practice, however,
retrieval outcomes systematically reflect perspectival biases: deviations
shaped by linguistic prevalence and cultural associations. We study two such
biases. First, prevalence bias refers to the tendency to favor entries from
prevalent languages over semantically faithful entries in image-to-text
retrieval. Second, association bias refers to the tendency to favor images
culturally associated with the query over semantically correct ones in
text-to-image retrieval. Results show that explicit alignment is a more
effective strategy for mitigating prevalence bias. However, association bias
remains a distinct and more challenging problem. These findings suggest that
achieving truly equitable multimodal systems requires targeted strategies
beyond simple data scaling and that bias arising from cultural association may
be treated as a more challenging problem than one arising from linguistic
prevalence.

Abstract: Recommender systems serve as foundational infrastructure in modern
information ecosystems, helping users navigate digital content and discover
items aligned with their preferences. At their core, recommender systems
address a fundamental problem: matching users with items. Over the past
decades, the field has experienced successive paradigm shifts, from
collaborative filtering and matrix factorization in the machine learning era to
neural architectures in the deep learning era. Recently, the emergence of
generative models, especially large language models (LLMs) and diffusion
models, have sparked a new paradigm: generative recommendation, which
reconceptualizes recommendation as a generation task rather than discriminative
scoring. This survey provides a comprehensive examination through a unified
tripartite framework spanning data, model, and task dimensions. Rather than
simply categorizing works, we systematically decompose approaches into
operational stages-data augmentation and unification, model alignment and
training, task formulation and execution. At the data level, generative models
enable knowledge-infused augmentation and agent-based simulation while unifying
heterogeneous signals. At the model level, we taxonomize LLM-based methods,
large recommendation models, and diffusion approaches, analyzing their
alignment mechanisms and innovations. At the task level, we illuminate new
capabilities including conversational interaction, explainable reasoning, and
personalized content generation. We identify five key advantages: world
knowledge integration, natural language understanding, reasoning capabilities,
scaling laws, and creative generation. We critically examine challenges in
benchmark design, model robustness, and deployment efficiency, while charting a
roadmap toward intelligent recommendation assistants that fundamentally reshape
human-information interaction.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of textual content on the Internet, efficient
large-scale semantic text retrieval has garnered increasing attention from both
academia and industry. Text hashing, which projects original texts into compact
binary hash codes, is a crucial method for this task. By using binary codes,
the semantic similarity computation for text pairs is significantly accelerated
via fast Hamming distance calculations, and storage costs are greatly reduced.
With the advancement of deep learning, deep text hashing has demonstrated
significant advantages over traditional, data-independent hashing techniques.
By leveraging deep neural networks, these methods can learn compact and
semantically rich binary representations directly from data, overcoming the
performance limitations of earlier approaches. This survey investigates current
deep text hashing methods by categorizing them based on their core components:
semantic extraction, hash code quality preservation, and other key
technologies. We then present a detailed evaluation schema with results on
several popular datasets, followed by a discussion of practical applications
and open-source tools for implementation. Finally, we conclude by discussing
key challenges and future research directions, including the integration of
deep text hashing with large language models to further advance the field. The

Abstract: Drug recommendation (DR) systems aim to support healthcare professionals in
selecting appropriate medications based on patients' medical conditions.
State-of-the-art approaches utilize deep learning techniques for improving DR,
but fall short in providing any insights on the derivation process of
recommendations -- a critical limitation in such high-stake applications. We
propose TraceDR, a novel DR system operating over a medical knowledge graph
(MKG), which ensures access to large-scale and high-quality information.
TraceDR simultaneously predicts drug recommendations and related evidence
within a multi-task learning framework, enabling traceability of medication
recommendations. For covering a more diverse set of diseases and drugs than
existing works, we devise a framework for automatically constructing patient
health records and release DrugRec, a new large-scale testbed for DR.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) are intelligent filtering methods that suggest
items to users based on their inferred preferences, derived from their
interaction history on the platform. Collaborative filtering-based RSs rely on
users past interactions to generate recommendations. However, when a user is
new to the platform, referred to as a cold-start user, there is no historical
data available, making it difficult to provide personalized recommendations. To
address this, rating elicitation techniques can be used to gather initial
ratings or preferences on selected items, helping to build an early
understanding of the user's tastes. Rating elicitation approaches are generally
categorized into two types: non-personalized and personalized. Decision
tree-based rating elicitation is a personalized method that queries users about
their preferences at each node of the tree until sufficient information is
gathered. In this paper, we propose an extension to the decision tree approach
for rating elicitation in the context of music recommendation. Our method: (i)
elicits not only item ratings but also preferences on attributes such as genres
to better cluster users, and (ii) uses item pairs instead of single items at
each node to more effectively learn user preferences. Experimental results
demonstrate that both proposed enhancements lead to improved performance,
particularly with a reduced number of queries.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly enhanced LLMs by
incorporating external information. However, prevailing agentic RAG approaches
are constrained by a critical limitation: they treat the retrieval process as a
black-box querying operation. This confines agents' actions to query issuing,
hindering its ability to tackle complex information-seeking tasks. To address
this, we introduce Interact-RAG, a new paradigm that elevates the LLM agent
from a passive query issuer into an active manipulator of the retrieval
process. We dismantle the black-box with a Corpus Interaction Engine, equipping
the agent with a set of action primitives for fine-grained control over
information retrieval. To further empower the agent on the entire RAG pipeline,
we first develop a reasoning-enhanced workflow, which enables both zero-shot
execution and the synthesis of interaction trajectories. We then leverage this
synthetic data to train a fully autonomous end-to-end agent via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by refinement with Reinforcement Learning (RL).
Extensive experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate that Interact-RAG
significantly outperforms other advanced methods, validating the efficacy of
our reasoning-interaction strategy.
