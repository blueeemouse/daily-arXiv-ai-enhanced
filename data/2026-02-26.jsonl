Unlike a call or conference room abstraction of existing video conferencing services, it uses a named stream abstraction, which is useful in many scenarios beyond just a call or conference. It keeps most of the application logic in the endpoint using the extensive application interface of this component, and keeps any vendor specific access control or signaling negotiation in a service-specific connector implementation. This allows an app developer to write once, and be able to run the web app on different servers or services. We also demonstrate its flexibility by implementing the connector for ten different existing systems and services. Decoupling the app from the hosted vendor service promotes innovation in the endpoint beyond what a single vendor locked client app can offer."}

To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch."}

This dependency complex exposes multi-attribute interactions and enables homological invariants (Betti numbers) to diagnose cyclic dependency structure. We define Simplicial Normal Form (SNF) as homological acyclicity of the dependency complex in positive dimensions, i.e., vanishing reduced homology for all $n \\ge 1$. SNF is intentionally weaker than contractibility and does not identify homology with homotopy. For decompositions, we give a topological reformulation of the classical binary lossless-join criterion: assuming dependency preservation, a decomposition is lossless exactly when the intersection attributes form a key for at least one component. Topologically, this yields a strong deformation retraction that trivializes the relevant Mayer--Vietoris boundary map. For multiway decompositions, we show how the nerve of a cover by induced subcomplexes provides a computable certificate: a 1-cycle in the nerve (detected by $H_1$) obstructs join-tree structure and aligns with cyclic join behavior in acyclic-scheme theory. Finally, we discuss an algorithmic consequence: Betti numbers of the dependency complex (or of a decomposition nerve) can be computed from boundary matrices and used as a lightweight schema diagnostic to localize \"unexplained\" dependency cycles, complementing standard FD-chase tests."}

We propose Latent Context Compilation, a framework that fundamentally shifts context processing from adaptation to compilation. By utilizing a disposable LoRA module as a compiler, we distill long contexts into compact buffer tokens -- stateless, portable memory artifacts that are plug-and-play compatible with frozen base models. Crucially, we introduce a self-aligned optimization strategy that eliminates the need for synthetic context-relevant QA pairs. By regularizing context reconstruction task with context-agnostic random queries, we force compressed tokens to reside within the model's existing instruction-following manifold. Experiments with Llama-3.1-8B demonstrate that Latent Context Compilation preserves fine-grained details and reasoning capabilities where prior methods falter, effectively decoupling memory density from model parameters even at a 16x compression ratio."}

This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \\emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.\n  We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \\cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\\cdot n\\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

Existing benchmarks primarily compare entire RAG pipelines or introduce new datasets, providing little guidance on selecting or combining retrievers themselves. Those that do compare retrievers directly use a limited set of evaluation tools which fail to capture complementary and overlapping strengths. This work presents MIGRASCOPE, a Mutual Information based RAG Retriever Analysis Scope. We revisit state-of-the-art retrievers and introduce principled metrics grounded in information and statistical estimation theory to quantify retrieval quality, redundancy, synergy, and marginal contribution.

To mitigate this, we propose a tensor-based execution path that delays premature linearization and preserves higher-dimensional locality through late materialization and structured intermediate layouts. Using a modified PostgreSQL-based prototype and controlled microbenchmarks, we show that under constrained memory settings (e.g., work_mem=1MB) conventional execution can spill hundreds of megabytes and exceed multi-second P99 latency, while the proposed path maintains stable execution and reduces P99 latency to sub-second levels. Our results suggest that representation timing is a first-class design variable for execution stability, complementing traditional optimization efforts focused on cardinality estimation and operator throughput."}

The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling. Third, attribution estimates based on proxy signals such as response similarity and entropy showed weak correlation with ground-truth leave-one-out values, indicating that practical attribution requires explicit counterfactual computation.

This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.\n  We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.\n  Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\\times$ on our in-house inference system.

We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition.

Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity.

At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency.

We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency."}

Most GR methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: (i) \\textit{item tokenization}, which maps each item to a sequence of discrete, hierarchically organized tokens; and (ii) \\textit{autoregressive generation}, which predicts the next item's tokens conditioned on the tokens of user's interaction history. Although hierarchical tokenization induces a prefix tree (trie) over items, standard autoregressive modeling with conventional Transformers often flattens item tokens into a linear stream and overlooks the underlying topology.\n  To address this, we propose TrieRec, a trie-aware generative recommendation method that augments Transformers with structural inductive biases via two positional encodings. First, a \\textit{trie-aware absolute positional encoding} aggregates a token's (node's) local structural context (\\eg depth, ancestors, and descendants) into the token representation. Second, a \\textit{topology-aware relative positional encoding} injects pairwise structural relations into self-attention to capture topology-induced semantic relatedness. TrieRec is also model-agnostic, efficient, and hyperparameter-free. In our experiments, we implement TrieRec within three representative GR backbones, achieving notably improvements of 8.83\\% on average across four real-world datasets."}

Here, we present AkiraRust, an LLM-driven repair and verification framework that incorporates a finite-state machine to dynamically adapt its detection and repair flow to runtime semantic conditions. AkiraRust introduces a dual-mode reasoning strategy that coordinates fast and slow thinking across multiple agents.

However, quality issues such as inconsistencies and uncertainties, can significantly impede the processing and subsequent use of data. Despite the centrality of data quality to a wide range of computational tasks, there is currently no broadly accepted, domain-independent consensus on the definition of data quality. Existing frameworks primarily define data quality in ways that are tailored to specific domains, data types, or contexts of use. Although quality assessment frameworks exist for specific domains, such as electronic health record data and linked data, corresponding approaches for descriptive information about cultural heritage objects remain underdeveloped. Moreover, existing quality definitions are often theoretical in nature and lack empirical validation based on real-world data problems. In this paper, we address these limitations by first defining a set of quality dimensions specifically designed to capture the characteristics of descriptive information about cultural heritage objects. Our definition is based on an in-depth analysis of existing dimensions and is illustrated through domain-specific examples. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our proposed quality definition using a curated set of real-world data quality problems from the cultural heritage domain. This empirical evaluation substantiates our definition of data quality, resulting in a comprehensive definition of data quality in this domain."}

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that GOPO achieves competitive generalization while maintaining stable gradient dynamics and entropy preservation in regimes where clipping-based methods plateau."}

In particular, LLMs have been employed as rerankers that reorder candidate items based on inferred user-item relevance. However, these approaches often require expensive online inference-time reasoning, leading to high latency that hampers real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce Persona4Rec, a recommendation framework that performs offline reasoning to construct interpretable persona representations of items, enabling lightweight and scalable real-time inference. In the offline stage, Persona4Rec leverages LLMs to reason over item reviews, inferring diverse user motivations that explain why different types of users may engage with an item; these inferred motivations are materialized as persona representations, providing multiple, human-interpretable views of each item. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on a single item representation, Persona4Rec learns to align user profiles with the most plausible item-side persona through a dedicated encoder, effectively transforming user-item relevance into user-persona relevance. At the online stage, this persona-profiled item index allows fast relevance computation without invoking expensive LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments show that Persona4Rec achieves performance comparable to recent LLM-based rerankers while substantially reducing inference time. Moreover, qualitative analysis confirms that persona representations not only drive efficient scoring but also provide intuitive, review-grounded explanations. These results demonstrate that Persona4Rec offers a practical and interpretable solution for next-generation recommender systems."}

ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 10, OOPSLA1)", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) for code editing have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent empirical studies reveal a fundamental disconnect between technical accuracy and developer productivity. Despite their strong benchmark performance, developers complete tasks 19% slower when using AI assistance, with over 68.81% of recommendations disrupting their mental flow. This misalignment stems from the use of static commit snapshots that lack temporal information, causing models to optimize for end results rather than the incremental, context-sensitive steps that align with developers' natural reasoning process.\n  To bridge this gap, we present EditFlow, which benchmarks and optimizes subsequent code edit recommendation systems through the reconstruction of developer editing flows. EditFlow addresses three key challenges. First, collecting edit-order data that reflects developers' flow is inherently difficult: manual annotation introduces prohibitive overhead, while development logs capture only single trajectories instead of all plausible editing flows. Second, benchmarking recommendation performance against developers' ongoing editing flow requires a digital-twin-like simulation that can faithfully simulate the editing process. Third, existing heterogeneous systems vary drastically in scale and architecture, posing challenges for developing a unified optimization strategy that endows all models with mental-flow awareness regardless of design or capability.\n  ......"}

However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.\n  In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data.

Low-loss regions of the landscapes correspond to the parameter sets that perform well on the training data. A key issue in machine learning is the performance of trained neural networks on previously unseen test data. Here, we investigate neural network training by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) - a non-convex global optimization algorithm which relies only on the gradient of the objective function. We contrast SGD solutions with those obtained via a non-stochastic quasi-Newton method, which utilizes curvature information to determine step direction and Golden Section Search to choose step size. We use several computational tools to investigate neural network parameters obtained by these two optimization methods, including kernel Principal Component Analysis and a novel, general-purpose algorithm for finding low-height paths between pairs of points on loss or energy landscapes, FourierPathFinder. We find that the choice of the optimizer profoundly affects the nature of the resulting solutions. SGD solutions tend to be separated by lower barriers than quasi-Newton solutions, even if both sets of solutions are regularized by early stopping to ensure adequate performance on test data. When allowed to fit extensively on the training data, quasi-Newton solutions occupy deeper minima on the loss landscapes that are not reached by SGD. These solutions are less generalizable to the test data however. Overall, SGD explores smooth basins of attraction, while quasi-Newton optimization is capable of finding deeper, more isolated minima that are more spread out in the parameter space. Our findings help understand both the topography of the loss landscapes and the fundamental role of landscape exploration strategies in creating robust, transferrable neural network models."}

Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.\n  Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.\n  These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently. The proposed methodology is immediately applicable to current heterogeneous nodes and is readily extensible to future systems that integrate even richer combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators."}

Conventional approaches typically rely on synchronizing high-dimensional item representations between the server and clients. This paradigm implicitly assumes that precise geometric alignment of embedding coordinates is necessary for collaboration across clients. We posit that establishing relative semantic relationships among items is more effective than enforcing shared representations. Specifically, global semantic relations serve as structural constraints for items. Within these constraints, the framework allows item representations to vary locally on each client, which flexibility enables the model to capture fine-grained user personalization while maintaining global consistency. To this end, we propose Cluster-Guided FedRec framework (CGFedRec), a framework that transforms uploaded embeddings into compact cluster labels. In this framework, the server functions as a global structure discoverer to learn item clusters and distributes only the resulting labels. This mechanism explicitly cuts off the downstream transmission of item embeddings, relieving clients from maintaining global shared item embeddings. Consequently, CGFedRec achieves the effective injection of global collaborative signals into local item representations without transmitting full embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation accuracy across multiple datasets."}

In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-HDC-DP framework achieves up to 83.3% total energy reduction compared with the baseline, while attaining about 90% accuracy in approximately 3.5X fewer communication rounds than the NN baseline."}

To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future."}

In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as \"Text-to-Big SQL\". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.\n  In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost."}

Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.\n  We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.\n  Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an \"optimally readable\" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.\n  These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code."}

However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality."}

To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods."}

In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting.

To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy.

Nonetheless, existing generation-based debug tools are limited to single-table queries and there is a substantial research gap regarding multi-table queries with join operators. In this paper, we propose TQS, a novel testing framework targeted at detecting logic bugs derived by queries involving multi-table joins. Given a target DBMS, TQS achieves the goal with two key components: Data-guided Schema and Query Generation (DSG) and Knowledge-guided Query Space Exploration (KQE). DSG addresses the key challenge of multi-table query debugging: how to generate ground-truth (query, result) pairs for verification. It adopts the database normalization technique to generate a testing schema and maintains a bitmap index for result tracking. To improve debug efficiency, DSG also artificially inserts some noises into the generated data. To avoid repetitive query space search, KQE forms the problem as isomorphic graph set discovery and combines the graph embedding and weighted random walk for query generation. We evaluated TQS on four popular DBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB and the gray release of an industry-leading cloud-native database, anonymized as X-DB. Experimental results show that TQS is effective in finding logic bugs of join optimization in database management systems.

We introduce JSAM (Joint client Selection and privacy compensAtion Mechanism), a Bayesian-optimal framework that simultaneously optimizes client selection probabilities and privacy compensation to maximize training effectiveness under budget constraints. Our approach transforms a complex 2N-dimensional optimization problem into an efficient three-dimensional formulation through novel theoretical characterization of optimal selection strategies. We prove that servers should preferentially select privacy-tolerant clients while excluding high-sensitivity participants, and uncover the counter-intuitive insight that clients with minimal privacy sensitivity may incur the highest cumulative costs due to frequent participation.

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance."}

The HiPPO framework, originally proposed by Gu & Dao et al., provides a principled approach to sequential compression by projecting signals onto orthogonal polynomial (OP) bases via structured linear ordinary differential equations. Subsequent works have embedded these dynamics in state space models (SSMs), where HiPPO structure serves as an initialization. Nonlinear successors of these SSM methods such as Mamba are state-of-the-art for many tasks with long-range dependencies, but the mechanisms by which they represent and prioritize history remain largely implicit. In this work, we revisit the HiPPO framework with the goal of making these mechanisms explicit. We show how polynomial representations of history can be extended to support capabilities of modern SSMs such as adaptive allocation of memory and associative memory while retaining direct interpretability in the OP basis. We introduce a unified framework comprising five such extensions, which we collectively refer to as a \"HiPPO zoo.\" Each extension exposes a specific modeling capability through an explicit, interpretable modification of the HiPPO framework. The resulting models adapt their memory online and train in streaming settings with efficient updates. We illustrate the behaviors and modeling advantages of these extensions through a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that capabilities typically associated with modern SSMs can be realized through explicit, interpretable polynomial memory structures."}

Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions."}

This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$.

When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method."}

Experiments on synthetic datasets show that VCDF improves VAR-LiNGAM by approximately 0.08-0.12 in both window and summary F1 scores across diverse data characteristics, with gains most pronounced for moderate-to-long sequences. The framework also benefits from longer sequences, yielding up to 0.18 absolute improvement on time series of length 1000 and above.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments."}

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations."}

This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants."}

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity."}

While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks."}

A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \\citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics.

Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning."}

In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed.

We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction.

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing."}

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks."}

This paper introduces an innovative architecture that harnesses Mamba, a state-space model with linear computational complexity, to facilitate comprehensive sequence modeling tailored for FJSP. In contrast to prevalent graph-attention-based frameworks that are computationally intensive for FJSP, we show our model is more efficient.

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction."}

Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces."}

Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits.

To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification.

In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online."}

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF."}

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance."}

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods."}

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem."}

Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings.

Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.\n  This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.\n  To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified."}

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags.

Furthermore, we highlight the importance of data fusion techniques, which combine AIS, onboard sensors, and meteorological data to enhance accuracy. We make the first attempt to discuss the emerging role of Explainable AI in enhancing model transparency for decision-making. Uniquely, key challenges, including data quality, availability, and the need for real-time optimization, are identified, and future research directions are proposed to address these gaps, with a focus on hybrid models, real-time optimization, and the standardization of datasets."}

We focus on a simple yet effective architecture consisting of three sparse layers with 99% sparsity followed by a dense layer, applied to image classification tasks such as MNIST and Fashion MNIST. By updating the topology of the sparse layers between each epoch, we achieve competitive accuracy despite the significantly reduced number of weights. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of the robustness of these networks, exploring their performance under various perturbations including random link removal, adversarial attack, and link weight shuffling. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that adaptive topology not only enhances efficiency but also maintains robustness. This work highlights the potential of adaptive sparse networks as a promising direction for developing efficient and reliable deep learning models."}

We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates."}

In this work, we introduce a sample-based neural solver for computing the Wasserstein geodesic between a source and target distribution, along with the associated velocity field. Building on the dynamical formulation of the optimal transport (OT) problem, we recast the constrained optimization as a minimax problem, using deep neural networks to approximate the relevant functions. This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field. The framework is flexible and readily extends to general cost functions, including the commonly used quadratic cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on both synthetic and real datasets."}

Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts."}

It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling.

Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility.

Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings."}

To address this, we propose DualWeaver, a novel framework that adapts univariate TSFMs (Uni-TSFMs) for multivariate forecasting by using a pair of learnable, structurally symmetric surrogate series. Generated by a shared auxiliary feature-fusion module that captures cross-variable dependencies, these surrogates are mapped to TSFM-compatible series via the forecasting objective. The symmetric structure enables parameter-free reconstruction of final predictions directly from the surrogates, without additional parametric decoding. A theoretically grounded regularization term is further introduced to enhance robustness against adaptation collapse. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets show that DualWeaver outperforms state-of-the-art multivariate forecasters in both accuracy and stability.

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria."}

In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds."}

While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across layers, and often lead to accuracy degradation or suboptimal resource usage, particularly at low bitwidths. In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, current heterogeneous quantization methods either needs huge brute-force design space search or lacks the adaptability to meet different hardware conditions, such as memory size, energy budget, and latency requirement. Filling these gaps, this work introduces \\textbf{\\textit{SigmaQuant}}, an adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization framework designed to efficiently balance accuracy and resource usage for varied edge environments without exhaustive search."}

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF."}

In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups."}

Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction."}

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection.

Although hierarchical tokenization induces a prefix tree (trie) over items, standard autoregressive modeling with conventional Transformers often flattens item tokens into a linear stream and overlooks the underlying topology.\n  To address this, we propose TrieRec, a trie-aware generative recommendation method that augments Transformers with structural inductive biases via two positional encodings.

In particular, LLMs have been employed as rerankers that reorder candidate items based on inferred user-item relevance. However, these approaches often require expensive online inference-time reasoning, leading to high latency that hampers real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce Persona4Rec, a recommendation framework that performs offline reasoning to construct interpretable persona representations of items, enabling lightweight and scalable real-time inference. In the offline stage, Persona4Rec leverages LLMs to reason over item reviews, inferring diverse user motivations that explain why different types of users may engage with an item; these inferred motivations are materialized as persona representations, providing multiple, human-interpretable views of each item. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on a single item representation, Persona4Rec learns to align user profiles with the most plausible item-side persona through a dedicated encoder, effectively transforming user-item relevance into user-persona relevance. At the online stage, this persona-profiled item index allows fast relevance computation without invoking expensive LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments show that Persona4Rec achieves performance comparable to recent LLM-based rerankers while substantially reducing inference time. Moreover, qualitative analysis confirms that persona representations not only drive efficient scoring but also provide intuitive, review-grounded explanations. These results demonstrate that Persona4Rec offers a practical and interpretable solution for next-generation recommender systems."}

Within these constraints, the framework allows item representations to vary locally on each client, which flexibility enables the model to capture fine-grained user personalization while maintaining global consistency. To this end, we propose Cluster-Guided FedRec framework (CGFedRec), a framework that transforms uploaded embeddings into compact cluster labels. In this framework, the server functions as a global structure discoverer to learn item clusters and distributes only the resulting labels. This mechanism explicitly cuts off the downstream transmission of item embeddings, relieving clients from maintaining global shared item embeddings. Consequently, CGFedRec achieves the effective injection of global collaborative signals into local item representations without transmitting full embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation accuracy across multiple datasets."}

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in improving test generation, particularly in achieving higher coverage. However, while existing LLM-based test generation solutions perform well on small, isolated code snippets, they struggle when applied to complex methods under test. To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods."}

We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens)."}
