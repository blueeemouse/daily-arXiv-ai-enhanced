With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment.

While directed fuzzing effectively drives path exploration, satisfying complex semantic constraints remains a persistent bottleneck in automated exploit generation. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative with their semantic reasoning capabilities; however, existing LLM-based approaches lack sufficient grounding in concrete execution behavior, limiting their ability to generate precise PoVs.\n  In this paper, we present DrillAgent, an agentic framework that reformulates PoV generation as an iterative hypothesis-verification-refinement process. To bridge the gap between static reasoning and dynamic execution, DrillAgent synergizes LLM-based semantic inference with feedback from concrete program states. The agent analyzes the target code to hypothesize inputs, observes execution behavior, and employs a novel mechanism to translate low-level execution traces into source-level constraints. This closed-loop design enables the agent to incrementally align its input generation with the precise requirements of the vulnerability. We evaluate DrillAgent on SEC-bench, a large-scale benchmark of real-world C/C++ vulnerabilities. Experimental results show that DrillAgent substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM agent baselines under fixed budget constraints, solving up to 52.8% more CVE tasks than the best-performing baseline.

To investigate these questions, this paper proposes DesBench, a design-aware benchmark for evaluating LLMs on three software design-related tasks: design-aware code generation, object-oriented modeling, and the design of acceptance test cases.

We evaluated seven state-of-the-art LLMs, including three DeepSeek R1, two Qwen2.5, and two GPT models, using DesBench. The results reveal that LLMs remain significantly challenged by the intricacies of software design: (1) For code generation, LLMs struggle to produce correct implementations when provided with only high-level or no designs. (2) In object-oriented modeling, while LLMs can accurately identify objects and classes, they face challenges in defining operations and inter-class relationships.

Current studies convert flowcharts into interlanguages (e.g., Graphviz) for Question Answering (QA), which effectively bridge modal gaps between questions and flowcharts. More importantly, they reveal the link relations between nodes in the flowchart, facilitating a shallow relation reasoning during tracing answers. However, the existing interlanguages still lose sight of intricate semantic/logic relationships such as Conditional and Causal relations. This hinders the deep reasoning for complex questions. To address the issue, we propose a novel Semantic Relation-Aware (SRA) FlowchartQA approach. It leverages Large Language Model (LLM) to detect the discourse semantic relations between nodes, by which a link-based interlanguage is upgraded to the semantic relation based interlanguage. In addition, we conduct an interlanguage-controllable reasoning process. In this process, the question intention is analyzed with the aim to determine the depth of reasoning (Shallow or Deep reasoning), as well as the well-matched interlanguage. We experiment on the benchmark dataset FlowVQA. The test results show that SRA yields widespread improvements when upgrading different interlanguages like Graphviz, Mermaid and Plantuml", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5(SRA)\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u95ee\u7b54\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u610f\u56fe\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ca\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u540c\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u5982Graphviz\u3001Mermaid\u548cPlantuml\u65f6\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8fde\u63a5\u95ee\u9898\u4e0e\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u7136\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49/\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aSRA\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc6\u522b\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u8bdd\u8bed\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u63a5\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u5347\u7ea7\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6b64\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u95ee\u9898\u610f\u56fe\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u6d45\u5c42\u6216\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\u3002", "result": "\u5728FlowVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5f53\u5347\u7ea7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8bed\u8a00\uff08\u5982Graphviz\u3001Mermaid\u548cPlantuml\uff09\u65f6\uff0cSRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SRA FlowchartQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u7a0b\u56fe\u95ee\u7b54\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u5ffd\u89c6\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49/\u903b\u8f91\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u7b54\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents LoPace (Lossless Optimized Prompt Accurate Compression Engine), a novel compression framework designed specifically for prompt storage in LLM applications. LoPace uses three different ways to compress data: Zstandard-based compression, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization with binary packing, and a hybrid method that combines the two. We show that LoPace saves an average of 72.2\\% of space while still allowing for 100\\% lossless reconstruction by testing it on 386 different prompts, such as code snippets, markdown documentation, and structured content. The hybrid method always works better than each technique on its own. It gets mean compression ratios of 4.89x (range: 1.22--19.09x) and speeds of 3.3--10.7 MB/s. Our findings show that LoPace is ready for production, with a small memory footprint (0.35 MB on average) and great scalability for big databases and real-time LLM apps.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLoPace\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b58\u50a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408Zstandard\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6253\u5305\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0cLoPace\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u635f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u770172.2%\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5728386\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4e00\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u793a\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LoPace\uff08Lossless Optimized Prompt Accurate Compression Engine\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3aLLM\u5e94\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eZstandard\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u3001\u5b57\u8282\u5bf9\u7f16\u7801\uff08BPE\uff09\u4e0e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6253\u5305\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9386\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u3001Markdown\u6587\u6863\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86LoPace\u80fd\u591f\u5e73\u5747\u8282\u770172.2%\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0100%\u65e0\u635f\u91cd\u6784\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u603b\u662f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u72ec\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u5e73\u5747\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u8fbe\u52304.89\u500d\uff08\u8303\u56f4\uff1a1.22-19.09\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e3a3.3\u81f310.7 MB/\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLoPace\u5177\u5907\u751f\u4ea7\u5c31\u7eea\u6027\uff0c\u62e5\u6709\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u5e73\u57470.35MB\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6LLM\u5e94\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u4f73\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

However, an SBOM often contain sensitive information that organizations are unwilling to disclose in full to anyone, for two main concerns: technological risks deriving from exposing proprietary dependencies or unpatched vulnerabilities, and business risks, deriving from exposing architectural strategies. Therefore, delivering a plaintext SBOM may result in the disruption of the intellectual property of a company. To address this, we present VeriSBOM, a trustless, selectively disclosed SBOM framework that provides cryptographic verifiability of SBOMs using zero-knowledge proofs. Within VeriSBOM, third parties can validate specific statements about a delivered software. Respectively, VeriSBOM allows independent third parties to verify if a software contains authentic dependencies distributed by official package managers and that the same dependencies satisfy rigorous policy constraints such as the absence of vulnerable dependencies or the adherence with specific licenses models. VeriSBOM leverages a scalable vector commitment scheme together with folding-based proof aggregation to produce succinct zero-knowledge proofs that attest to security and compliance properties while preserving confidentiality. Crucially, the verification process requires no trust in the SBOM publisher beyond the soundness of the underlying primitives, and third parties can independently check proofs against the public cryptographic commitments.

However, as the number of experts grows, existing merging implementations treat model parameters as unstructured files and execute merges in a stateless, one-shot manner, leading to excessive disk I/O, redundant parameter scans, and poor scalability.\n  In this paper, we present \\textbf{MergePipe}, a parameter management system for scalable LLM merging. MergePipe is the first system that treats LLM merging as a data management and execution problem, and introduces a catalog-driven abstraction over model parameters, merge plans, and execution lineage. At its core, MergePipe employs a cost-aware planner that explicitly models expert parameter I/O and enforces user-specified I/O budgets, followed by a streaming execution engine that materializes merged models under transactional guarantees. Our key insight is that while base model reads and output writes are unavoidable, expert parameter reads dominate merge cost and constitute the primary optimization target. By making expert access budget-aware throughout planning and execution, MergePipe mitigates the $O(K)$ I/O growth of naive pipelines and achieves predictable scaling behavior. Experiments show that MergePipe reduces total I/O by up to an order of magnitude and delivers up to $11\\times$ end-to-end speedups (up to 90\\% wall-time reduction) over state-of-the-art LLM merging pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MergePipe\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u548c\u6267\u884c\u8c31\u7cfb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002MergePipe\u91c7\u7528\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u5728\u4e8b\u52a1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11I/O\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u89c6\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u91c7\u53d6\u65e0\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u5408\u5e76\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fc7\u591a\u7684\u78c1\u76d8I/O\u3001\u5197\u4f59\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MergePipe\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "MergePipe\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u5f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5c42\u8986\u76d6\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5408\u5e76\u8ba1\u5212\u53ca\u6267\u884c\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u90e8\u5206\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u4e13\u5bb6\u53c2\u6570I/O\u5e76\u4e14\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684I/O\u9884\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d41\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u4e8b\u52a1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u5e76\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u7ba1\u9053\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cMergePipe\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u603b\u7684I/O\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe11\u500d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff08\u6700\u591a\u51cf\u5c1190%\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u5e76\u89c6\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0cMergePipe\u6210\u529f\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86I/O\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5408\u5e76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, in real-world edge environments, collaborative multimodal learning is challenged by modality heterogeneity (different modality combinations across domains) and model-structure heterogeneity (different modality-specific encoders/fusion modules. To address these issues, we propose ML-ECS, a collaborative multimodal learning framework that enables joint training between a server-based model and heterogeneous edge models. This framework consists of four components: (1) cross-modal contrastive learning (CCL) to align modality representations in a shared latent space, (2) adaptive multimodal tuning (AMT) to preserve domain-specific knowledge from local datasets, (3) modality-aware model aggregation (MMA) to robustly aggregate while mitigating noise caused by missing modalities, and (4) SLM-enhanced CCL (SE-CCL) to facilitate bidirectional knowledge transfer between cloud and edge. Experimental results on various multimodal tasks show that \\pname consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines under varying modality availability, achieving improvements of 5.44% to 12.08% in Rouge-LSum and improving both client- and server-side performance. In addition, by communicating only low-rank LoRA parameters and fused representations, ML-ECS achieves high communication efficiency, requiring only 0.65% of the total parameter volume.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aML-ECS\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60(CCL)\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8c03\u6574(AMT)\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408(MMA)\u4ee5\u53caSLM\u589e\u5f3aCCL(SE-CCL)\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8d8a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ee5\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fb9\u7f18\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u5408\u53ca\u7279\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u5668/\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ML-ECS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8c03\u4f18\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u6a21\u6001\u610f\u8bc6\u6a21\u578b\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u6c47\u603b\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u4ee5\u53caSLM\u589e\u5f3a\u7684CCL\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e91\u7aef\u4e0e\u8fb9\u7f18\u95f4\u53cc\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u9762\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0cML-ECS\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0cRouge-LSum\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.44%\u523012.08%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u548c\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7aef\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4ea4\u6d41\u4f4e\u79e9LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u878d\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0cML-ECS\u8fbe\u6210\u4e86\u4ec5\u9700\u603b\u53c2\u6570\u4f53\u79ef0.65%\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u8baf\u3002", "conclusion": "ML-ECS\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4e91\u534f\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Personal data and fine-tuning remain on-device, while the cloud LLM contributes general knowledge without exposing proprietary weights. A heterogeneity-aware LoRA adaptation strategy enables efficient edge deployment across diverse hardware, and a logit-level fusion mechanism enables real-time coordination between edge and cloud models.

While their impact is clear, most studies are short-term, focused on individual experiments. The sustained, team-level effects on productivity within industrial agile environments remain largely uncharacterized. Goal: This study aims to provide a longitudinal evaluation of GenAI's impact on agile software teams. We characterize its effect on developers' productivity by applying the multi-dimensional SPACE framework. Method: We conducted a multi-case longitudinal study involving 3 agile teams at a large technology consulting firm for around 13 months. We collected and compared quantitative telemetry (Jira, SonarQube, Git) and qualitative survey data from historical (pre-adoption) and research (post-adoption) sprints. Conclusion: GenAI tools can significantly improve team performance and well-being. Our key finding is a sharp increase in Performance and perceived Efficiency concurrent with flat developer Activity. This suggests GenAI increases the value density of development work, not its volume. This finding validates the necessity of multi-dimensional frameworks like SPACE to capture the true, nuanced impact of GenAI in situ, which would be invisible to studies measuring Activity alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u671f13\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u591a\u6848\u4f8b\u7eb5\u5411\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u654f\u6377\u8f6f\u4ef6\u56e2\u961f\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGenAI\u5de5\u5177\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u56e2\u961f\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u5e78\u798f\u611f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7ee9\u6548\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u53d1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u5982SPACE\u6765\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30GenAI\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u578b\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08GenAI\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7814\u7a76\u90fd\u662f\u77ed\u671f\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u4e2a\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u654f\u6377\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u3001\u56e2\u961f\u7ea7\u751f\u4ea7\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6848\u4f8b\u7eb5\u5411\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca\u4e00\u5bb6\u5927\u578b\u6280\u672f\u54a8\u8be2\u516c\u53f8\u76843\u4e2a\u654f\u6377\u56e2\u961f\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u7ea613\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5386\u53f2\u51b2\u523a\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u524d\uff09\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u51b2\u523a\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u540e\uff09\u671f\u95f4\u6765\u81eaJira\u3001SonarQube\u3001Git\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u9065\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b9a\u6027\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cGenAI\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u5e78\u798f\u611f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7ee9\u6548\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u7684\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740GenAI\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f00\u53d1\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ef7\u503c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u975e\u5176\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "GenAI\u5de5\u5177\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u7279\u522b\u4f53\u73b0\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bc6\u5ea6\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u589e\u52a0\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u4e0a\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u50cfSPACE\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u5230GenAI\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f71\u54cd\u662f\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d3b\u52a8\u91cf\u65e0\u6cd5\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u3002"}}

Active learning (AL) aims to improve the performance-to-annotation ratio by using query methods (QMs) to iteratively select the most informative samples. While AL research focuses mainly on QM development, the evaluation of this iterative process lacks appropriate performance metrics. This work reviews eight years of AL evaluation literature and formally introduces the speed-up factor, a quantitative multi-iteration QM performance metric that indicates the fraction of samples needed to match random sampling performance. Using four datasets from diverse domains and seven QMs of various types, we empirically evaluate the speed-up factor and compare it with state-of-the-art AL performance metrics. The results confirm the assumptions underlying the speed-up factor, demonstrate its accuracy in capturing the described fraction, and reveal its superior stability across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u516b\u5e74\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6587\u732e\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e03\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u8de8\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff08AL\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u7684\u65b0\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6db5\u76d6\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e03\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u6355\u6349\u6240\u63cf\u8ff0\u6837\u672c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8fed\u4ee3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a0\u901f\u56e0\u5b50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5ea6\u91cf\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u67e5\u8be2\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

In this position paper, we propose framing the prevalence of IP as a form of Human Debt and discuss the relation with the ICSE2026 Pre Survey on the Future of Software Engineering results. Similar to technical debt, which arises when short-term goals are prioritized over long-term structural integrity, Human Debt accumulates due to gaps in psychological safety and inclusive support within socio-technical ecosystems. We observe that this debt is not distributed equally, it weighs heavier on underrepresented engineers and researchers, who face compounded challenges within traditional hierarchical structures and academic environments. We propose cultural refactoring, transparency and active maintenance through allyship, suggesting that leaders and institutions must address the environmental factors that exacerbate these feelings, ensuring a sustainable ecosystem for all professionals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u5192\u540d\u9876\u66ff\u73b0\u8c61\uff08IP\uff09\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5176\u4e0eICSE2026\u5173\u4e8e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u672a\u6765\u9884\u8c03\u67e5\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u5982\u540c\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u56e0\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e00\u6837\uff0c\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u5219\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5fc3\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u652f\u6301\u800c\u79ef\u7d2f\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u503a\u52a1\u5bf9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u66f4\u5927\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u3001\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u76df\u5173\u7cfb\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u547c\u5401\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u673a\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u52a0\u5267\u8fd9\u4e9b\u611f\u53d7\u7684\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5b58\u5728\u5192\u540d\u9876\u66ff\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u4ece\u4e2a\u4eba\u5185\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u770b\u5f85\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u2018\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u2019\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5f3a\u8c03\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u6b64\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b66\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u66f4\u591a\u6311\u6218\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u6210\u5458\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6280\u672f\u503a\u52a1\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eICSE2026\u9884\u8c03\u67e5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u884c\u4e1a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u8d8b\u52bf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u5728\u5185\u7684\u51e0\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6216\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c06\u5192\u540d\u9876\u66ff\u73b0\u8c61\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u6211\u4eec\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u7ed9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u793e\u533a\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65bd\u6587\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u7b49\u63aa\u65bd\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u79cd\u503a\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u52a0\u5065\u5eb7\u548c\u5305\u5bb9\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u6240\u6709\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u6210\u957f\u5e76\u611f\u5230\u88ab\u63a5\u7eb3\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5fc5\u987b\u6b63\u89c6\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u597d\u4eba\u529b\u503a\u52a1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6539\u53d8\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6587\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\u548c\u673a\u6784\u91c7\u53d6\u5177\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u6765\u521b\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u52a0\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u652f\u6301\u6027\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002"}}

Residual Quantization (RQ)-based approaches restrict semantic IDs to be short to enable tractable sequential modeling, while Optimized Product Quantization (OPQ)-based methods compress long semantic IDs through naive rigid aggregation, inevitably discarding fine-grained semantic information. To resolve this dilemma, we propose ACERec, a novel framework that decouples the granularity gap between fine-grained tokenization and efficient sequential modeling. It employs an Attentive Token Merger to distill long expressive semantic tokens into compact latents and introduces a dedicated Intent Token serving as a dynamic prediction anchor. To capture cohesive user intents, we guide the learning process via a dual-granularity objective, harmonizing fine-grained token prediction with global item-level semantic alignment.

The treatment group received a three-session coaching intervention, while the control group received it after an observation phase. IP was assessed using the Clance Impostor Phenomenon Scale (CIPS), alongside evaluated measures of well-being (WHO-5), life satisfaction (SWLS), and affect (PANAS).\n  Results: The coaching resulted in modest reductions in CIPS scores, whereas the control group also improved during the observation phase, suggesting that contextual and temporal factors may have exerted a stronger influence than the formal intervention.\n  Conclusion: These results suggest that coaching may support reflection and awareness related to IP, yet other contextual aspects of team collaboration and project work might also contribute to these changes.

We assume the stochastic gradient noise has a finite $p$-th moment for some $p \\in (1,2]$, and measure convergence after $T$ iterations. While clipping and normalization are parallel tools for stabilizing training of SGD under heavy-tailed noise, there is a fundamental separation in their worst-case properties in stochastically preconditioned settings. We demonstrate that normalization guarantees convergence to a first-order stationary point at rate $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})$ when problem parameters are known, and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{2p}})$ when problem parameters are unknown, matching the optimal rates for normalized SGD, respectively. In contrast, we prove that clipping may fail to converge in the worst case due to the statistical dependence between the stochastic preconditioner and the gradient estimates. To enable the analysis, we develop a novel vector-valued Burkholder-type inequality that may be of independent interest. These results provide a theoretical explanation for the empirical preference for normalization over clipping in large-scale model training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08SPSGD\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u52a0\u901f\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u6bd4\u88c1\u526a\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u5bf9SPSGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ca\u5176\u52a0\u901f\u7248\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u533a\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5047\u8bbe\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u7684p-\u9636\u77e9\uff08p \u2208 (1,2]\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728T\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u6027\u6765\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u503cBurkholder\u578b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u5f53\u95ee\u9898\u53c2\u6570\u5df2\u77e5\u65f6\u4ee5\\(\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{3p-2}})\\)\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u9636\u9a7b\u70b9\uff1b\u5f53\u672a\u77e5\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u4ee5\\(\\mathcal{O}(T^{-\\frac{p-1}{2p}})\\)\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u88c1\u526a\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7edf\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u574f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u88c1\u526a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u66f4\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

Prior work often submits formulated problems directly to black-box quantum or quantum-inspired solvers with the expectation of directly obtaining a good final solution. Due to the black-box nature of these solvers, users cannot perform fine-grained control over the solving procedure to balance the accuracy and efficiency, which in turn limits flexibility in real-time settings where most database problems arise. Moreover, it leads to limited potential for handling large-scale database optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a vision for the first real-time quantum-augmented database system, enabling transparent solutions for database optimization problems. We develop two complementary scalability strategies to address large-scale challenges, overcomplexity, and oversizing that exceed hardware limits. We integrate our approach with a database query optimizer as a preliminary prototype, evaluating on real-world workload, achieving up to 14x improvement over the classical query optimizer.

However, in large-scale industrial scenarios, such models often suffer from inherent myopia: due to single-step inference and strict latency constraints, they tend to collapse diverse user intents into locally optimal predictions, failing to capture long-horizon and multi-item consumption patterns. Moreover, real-world retrieval systems must follow explicit retrieval instructions, such as category-level control and policy constraints. Incorporating such instruction-following behavior into generative retrieval remains challenging, as existing conditioning or post-hoc filtering approaches often compromise relevance or efficiency. In this work, we present Climber-Pilot, a unified generative retrieval framework to address both limitations. First, we introduce Time-Aware Multi-Item Prediction (TAMIP), a novel training paradigm designed to mitigate inherent myopia in generative retrieval. By distilling long-horizon, multi-item foresight into model parameters through time-aware masking, TAMIP alleviates locally optimal predictions while preserving efficient single-step inference. Second, to support flexible instruction-following retrieval, we propose Condition-Guided Sparse Attention (CGSA), which incorporates business constraints directly into the generative process via sparse attention, without introducing additional inference steps. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing at NetEase Cloud Music, one of the largest music streaming platforms, demonstrate that Climber-Pilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 4.24\\% lift of the core business metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6Climber-Pilot\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u6311\u6218\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u9884\u6d4b(TAMIP)\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee5\u53ca\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b(CGSA)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\u878d\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cClimber-Pilot\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e864.24%\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u5854\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9650\u5236\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u5230\u957f\u671f\u548c\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fd8\u9700\u9075\u5faa\u5982\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u7b49\u660e\u786e\u68c0\u7d22\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u884c\u4e3a\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4f5c\u7528\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6216\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u9884\u6d4b\uff08TAMIP\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u77ed\u89c6\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u906e\u853d\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u957f\u671f\u3001\u591a\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u9884\u89c1\u6027\u63d0\u70bc\u81f3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4e2d\uff0cTAMIP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u5355\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n2. \u4e3a\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08CGSA\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u4e1a\u52a1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u7f51\u6613\u4e91\u97f3\u4e50\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\uff0cClimber-Pilot\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6838\u5fc3\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u68074.24%\u7684\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "Climber-Pilot\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u68c0\u7d22\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u4e1a\u52a1\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u652f\u6301\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, these models are often limited by long-term instabilities, climatological drift, and substantial computational costs during training and inference, restricting their broader application for climate studies. Addressing these limitations, Guan et al. (2024) introduced LUCIE, a lightweight, physically consistent climate emulator utilizing a Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) architecture. This model is able to reproduce accurate long-term statistics including climatological mean and seasonal variability. However, LUCIE's native resolution (~300 km) is inadequate for detailed regional impact assessments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a deep learning-based downscaling framework, leveraging probabilistic diffusion-based generative models with conditional and posterior sampling frameworks. These models downscale coarse LUCIE outputs to 25 km resolution. They are trained on approximately 14,000 ERA5 timesteps spanning 2000-2009 and evaluated on LUCIE predictions from 2010 to 2020. Model performance is assessed through diverse metrics, including latitude-averaged RMSE, power spectrum, probability density functions and First Empirical Orthogonal Function of the zonal wind.

In practical federated learning scenarios, client heterogeneity in system resources and data distributions motivates heterogeneous LoRA ranks across clients. We identify a previously overlooked phenomenon in heterogeneous FedLoRA, termed rank collapse, where the energy of the global update concentrates on the minimum shared rank, resulting in suboptimal performance and high sensitivity to rank configurations. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal the root cause of rank collapse: a mismatch between rank-agnostic aggregation weights and rank-dependent client contributions, which systematically suppresses higher-rank updates at a geometric rate over rounds. Motivated by this insight, we propose raFLoRA, a rank-partitioned aggregation method that decomposes local updates into rank partitions and then aggregates each partition weighted by its effective client contributions. Extensive experiments across classification and reasoning tasks show that raFLoRA prevents rank collapse, improves model performance, and preserves communication efficiency compared to state-of-the-art FedLoRA baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3araFLoRA\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\u4e3a\u79e9\u5206\u533a\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u533a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u6784FedLoRA\u4e2d\u7684\u79e9\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u9632\u6b62\u79e9\u584c\u9677\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u4e86\u8de8\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684LoRA\u7b49\u7ea7\u5f02\u8d28\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5148\u524d\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5f53\u5168\u5c40\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5171\u4eab\u7b49\u7ea7\u4e0a\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u5e76\u5bf9\u7b49\u7ea7\u914d\u7f6e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u79f0\u4e3a\u2018\u79e9\u584c\u9677\u2019\u3002", "method": "\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86raFLoRA\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b49\u7ea7\u5212\u5206\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u672c\u5730\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7b49\u7ea7\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f9d\u636e\u5404\u5206\u533a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0craFLoRA\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u79e9\u584c\u9677\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684FedLoRA\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u4e14\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "raFLoRA\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784FedLoRA\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u79e9\u584c\u9677\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u8fd8\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

To overcome this bottleneck, we propose GEMs (Generative rEcommendation with a Multi-stream decoder), a novel and unified framework designed to break the long-sequence barrier by capturing users' lifelong interaction sequences through a multi-stream perspective. Specifically, GEMs partitions user behaviors into three temporal streams$\\unicode{x2014}$Recent, Mid-term, and Lifecycle$\\unicode{x2014}$and employs tailored inference schemes for each: a one-stage real-time extractor for immediate dynamics, a lightweight indexer for cross attention to balance accuracy and cost for mid-term sequences, and a two-stage offline-online compression module for lifelong modeling. These streams are integrated via a parameter-free fusion strategy to enable holistic interest representation. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that GEMs significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recommendation accuracy. Notably, GEMs is the first lifelong GR framework successfully deployed in a high-concurrency industrial environment, achieving superior inference efficiency while processing user sequences of over 100,000 interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "GEMs, a multi-stream decoder framework for generative recommendations, effectively handles long user behavior sequences by dividing them into Recent, Mid-term, and Lifecycle streams, each with its own processing method, to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency.", "motivation": "Generative recommendations (GR) struggle with the high computational cost of processing very long user behavior sequences, which limits the sequence length and hinders the model's ability to capture users' lifelong interests. Additionally, attention mechanisms tend to have a 'recency bias', making it difficult to learn from long-term history.", "method": "GEMs (Generative rEcommendation with a Multi-stream decoder) is introduced as a new framework that overcomes the challenge of long sequences by splitting user behaviors into three temporal streams: Recent, Mid-term, and Lifecycle. Each stream uses a different inference scheme: a real-time extractor for recent dynamics, a lightweight indexer for mid-term cross-attention, and a two-stage offline-online module for lifelong modeling. The streams are combined using a parameter-free fusion strategy to create a comprehensive interest representation.", "result": "Experiments on large-scale industrial datasets show that GEMs surpasses existing methods in terms of recommendation accuracy. It has also been successfully implemented in an industrial setting, demonstrating exceptional inference efficiency while handling user sequences exceeding 100,000 interactions.", "conclusion": "GEMs presents a novel approach to generative recommendations by efficiently managing extremely long user behavior sequences through a multi-stream perspective, thereby enhancing both the accuracy and efficiency of recommendations."}}

Language is increasingly modeled in curved geometries - hyperbolic spaces for hierarchy, mixed-curvature manifolds for compositional structure - yet a basic scientific question remains unresolved: what does curvature mean for text itself, in a way that is native to language rather than an artifact of the embedding space we choose? We argue that text does indeed have curvature, and show how to detect it, define it, and use it. To this end, we propose Texture, a text-native, word-level discrete curvature signal, and make three contributions. (a) Existence: We provide empirical and theoretical certificates that semantic inference in natural corpora is non-flat, i.e. language has inherent curvature. (b) Definition: We define Texture by reconciling left- and right-context beliefs around a masked word through a Schrodinger bridge, yielding a curvature field that is positive where context focuses meaning and negative where it fans out into competing continuations. (c) Utility: Texture is actionable: it serves as a general-purpose measurement and control primitive enabling geometry without geometric training; we instantiate it on two representative tasks, improving long-context inference through curvature-guided compression and retrieval-augmented generation through curvature-guided routing. Together, our results establish a text-native curvature paradigm, making curvature measurable and practically useful.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u540d\u4e3aTexture\u7684\u6587\u672c\u539f\u751f\u3001\u8bcd\u7ea7\u79bb\u6563\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u66f2\u7387\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u975e\u5e73\u5766\u7684\uff0c\u5373\u8bed\u8a00\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u3002Texture\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u4e00\u4e2a\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u8bcd\u5de6\u53f3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6765\u5b9a\u4e49\u66f2\u7387\u573a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u538b\u7f29\u6539\u5584\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u8def\u7531\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u91c7\u7528\u5f2f\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u5b66\uff08\u5982\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u7528\u4e8e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u66f2\u7387\u6d41\u5f62\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec4\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u672c\u8eab\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u66f2\u7387\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u6240\u9009\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u65e0\u5173\u800c\u5c5e\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aTexture\u7684\u6587\u5b57\u7ea7\u79bb\u6563\u66f2\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u8c03\u548c\u4e86\u56f4\u7ed5\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u5355\u8bcd\u7684\u5de6\u53f3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9a\u4e49\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f2\u7387\u573a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u6b63\u503c\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u7126\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u8d1f\u503c\u5219\u4ee3\u8868\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u6563\u6210\u7ade\u4e89\u5ef6\u7eed\u4e4b\u5904\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u975e\u5e73\u76f4\u7684\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u786e\u5b9e\u62e5\u6709\u5185\u5728\u66f2\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528Texture\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u822c\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u6539\u5584\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u589e\u5f3a\u68c0\u7d22\u8f85\u52a9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u539f\u751f\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u66f2\u7387\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u6709\u7528\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically flatten academic papers into unstructured chunks during preprocessing, which destroys the native hierarchical structure. This loss forces retrieval to operate in a disordered space, thereby producing fragmented contexts, misallocating tokens to non-evidential regions under finite token budgets, and increasing the reasoning burden for downstream language models. To address these issues, we propose PT-RAG, an RAG framework that treats the native hierarchical structure of academic papers as a low-entropy retrieval prior. PT-RAG first inherits the native hierarchy to construct a structure-fidelity PaperTree index, which prevents entropy increase at the source. It then designs a path-guided retrieval mechanism that aligns query semantics to relevant sections and selects high relevance root-to-leaf paths under a fixed token budget, yielding compact, coherent, and low-entropy retrieval contexts. In contrast to existing RAG approaches, PT-RAG avoids entropy increase caused by destructive preprocessing and provides a native low-entropy structural basis for subsequent retrieval. To assess this design, we introduce entropy-based structural diagnostics that quantify retrieval fragmentation and evidence allocation accuracy. On three academic question-answering benchmarks, PT-RAG achieves consistently lower section entropy and evidence alignment cross entropy than strong baselines, indicating reduced context fragmentation and more precise allocation to evidential regions. These structural advantages directly translate into higher answer quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPT-RAG\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u539f\u751f\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u5728\u957f\u7bc7\u5b66\u672f\u6587\u7ae0\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684PaperTree\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5173\u5ea6\u9ad8\u7684\u4ece\u6839\u5230\u53f6\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u71b5\u4f4e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPT-RAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7bc7\u5b66\u672f\u6587\u7ae0\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u539f\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f97\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7247\u6bb5\u5316\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e0d\u6070\u5f53\u5730\u5c06\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e86\u975e\u8bc1\u636e\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684PT-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "PT-RAG\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u5148\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5c42\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684PaperTree\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u71b5\u68c0\u7d22\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u968f\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5173\u7ae0\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\u5185\u6311\u9009\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u4ece\u6839\u81f3\u53f6\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u751f\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u71b5\u503c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b66\u672f\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cPT-RAG\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7ae0\u8282\u71b5\u548c\u8bc1\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u52a0\u7cbe\u51c6\u5730\u5411\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u8d44\u6e90\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "PT-RAG\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u672f\u8bba\u6587\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u71b5\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5728\u907f\u514d\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u71b5\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u68c0\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4f4e\u71b5\u7ed3\u6784\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\u4ee4\u724c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

This ability to reason about dynamic program behavior is fundamental to effective software engineering and increasingly supported by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies on code reasoning focus primarily on isolated code snippets, overlooking the complexity of real-world scenarios involving external API interactions and unfamiliar functions. This gap hinders our understanding of what truly makes code reasoning challenging for LLMs across diverse programming contexts.\n  We present CodeGlance, a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios: intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. Through systematic evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that unseen function reasoning poses significant challenges especially for smaller models, with Qwen2.5-3b achieving only 6.0\\% accuracy on unseen functions compared to 37.5\\% on familiar APIs. We identify critical code complexity features -- including execution trace length, API invocation count, and control flow complexity -- that significantly impact code reasoning difficulty across scenarios. We further investigate how common augmentation strategies, including CoT, document retrieval, and code search, can improve reasoning performance, finding that their effectiveness varies substantially depending on whether challenges stem from logical complexity or knowledge gaps. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing more capable code reasoning systems and deploying LLM-based programming assistants in real-world software development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86CodeGlance\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u5185\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001API\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f307\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u529f\u80fd\u5c24\u5176\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6267\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u957f\u5ea6\u3001API\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5b64\u7acb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6d89\u53ca\u5916\u90e8API\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u771f\u6b63\u4f7f\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CodeGlance\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ef4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u67e5\u4e09\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5185\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u3001API\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u672a\u89c1\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf97\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6765\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u672a\u89c1\u51fd\u6570\u63a8\u7406\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u7279\u522b\u5927\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u4f8b\u5982\uff0cQwen2.5-3b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a6.0%\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u719f\u6089\u7684API\u4e0a\u5219\u4e3a37.5%\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u2014\u2014\u5982\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u957f\u5ea6\u3001API\u8c03\u7528\u6b21\u6570\u53ca\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u6781\u5927\u5f71\u54cd\u7740\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5e38\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u6587\u6863\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u641c\u7d22\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u8ba8\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u6e90\u81ea\u903b\u8f91\u590d\u6742\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u53e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u9488\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u52a9\u624b\u90e8\u7f72\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u53bb\u3002"}}

This paper provides a tutorial on the PyCM library, demonstrating its utility in conducting deep-dive evaluations of multi-class classifiers. By examining two different case scenarios, we illustrate how the choice of evaluation metrics can fundamentally shift the interpretation of a model's efficacy. Our findings emphasize that a multi-dimensional evaluation framework is essential for uncovering small but important differences in model performance.

We here address three critical challenges in the current SOTA solution: insufficient retrieval granularity, vulnerability to environmental noise, and prohibitive efficiency-performance gap. Our primary contribution lies in two fundamental paradigm shifts. First, we transitioned the embedding paradigm from traditional contrastive learning to an absolute ID-recognition task. Through anchoring instances to a globally consistent latent space defined by billions of semantic prototypes, we successfully overcome the stochasticity and granularity bottlenecks inherent in existing embedding solutions. Second, we evolved the generative reranker from isolated pointwise evaluation to the compare-and-calibrate listwise policy. By synergizing chunk-based comparative reasoning with calibrated absolute relevance scoring, the system achieves nuanced discriminative resolution while circumventing the prohibitive latency typically associated with conventional reranking methods. Extensive offline benchmarks and online A/B tests on Alibaba e-commerce platform confirm that Pailitao-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance and delivers substantial business impact.

Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5ACC++\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5185\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e5f\u4f1a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7535\u8def\u662f\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u793a\u5bb6\u65cf\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5c42\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u7535\u8def\u65f6\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\uff0c\u7535\u8def\u4e5f\u662f\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56e0\u679c\u901a\u4fe1\uff08ACC\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7248\u672cACC++\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5c06ACC++\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eGPT-2\u3001Pythia\u548cGemma 2\u4e2d\u7684\u95f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\uff08IOI\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5728\u95f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u7684\u7535\u8def\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u677f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5b58\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u805a\u7c7b\u6210\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7535\u8def\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u5355\u5143\u4ece\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u63d0\u793a\u4e0a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u7535\u8def\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5b9a\u673a\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7535\u8def\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

With the rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), leveraging their multimodal understanding capabilities to enrich item semantic representation has emerged as an effective enhancement strategy for SRS. However, existing MLLM-enhanced recommendation methods still suffer from two key limitations. First, they struggle to effectively align multimodal representations, leading to suboptimal utilization of semantic information across modalities. Second, they often overly rely on MLLM-generated content while overlooking the fine-grained semantic cues contained in the original textual data of items. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-view MLLM-based Enhancing framework for multimodal Sequential Recommendation (DMESR). For the misalignment issue, we employ a contrastive learning mechanism to align the cross-modal semantic representations generated by MLLMs. For the loss of fine-grained semantics, we introduce a cross-attention fusion module that integrates the coarse-grained semantic knowledge obtained from MLLMs with the fine-grained original textual semantics. Finally, these two fused representations can be seamlessly integrated into the downstream sequential recommendation models. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets and three popular sequential recommendation architectures demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2MLLM\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff08DMESR\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709MLLM\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u5bf9\u9f50\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u7ed3\u5408\u7c97\u7565\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(MLLM)\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u9879\u76ee\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56MLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u9879\u76ee\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aDMESR\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "DMESR\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7531MLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u4eceMLLM\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u7c97\u7565\u8bed\u4e49\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u6765\u81ea\u9879\u76ee\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u672c\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u540e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u5730\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e09\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684DMESR\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f88\u5f3a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u6b21\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8eMLLM\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, manual software maintenance is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, which highlights the urgent need for automation. Learning from maintenance activities conducted on other software systems offers an effective way to improve efficiency. In particular, recent research has demonstrated that migration-based approaches transfer knowledge, artifacts, or solutions from one system to another and show strong potential in tasks such as API evolution adaptation, software testing, and migrating patches for fault correction. This makes migration-based maintenance a valuable research direction for advancing automated maintenance.\n  This paper takes a step further by presenting the first systematic research agenda on migration-based approaches to software maintenance. We characterize the migration-based maintenance lifecycle through four key stages: \\ding{182} identifying a maintenance task that can be addressed through migration, \\ding{183} selecting suitable migration sources for the target project,\\ding{184} matching relevant data across systems and adapting the migrated data to the target context, and \\ding{185} validating the correctness of the migration. We also analyze the challenges that may arise at each stage. Our goal is to encourage the community to explore migration-based approaches more thoroughly and to tackle the key challenges that must be solved to advance automated software maintenance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u7ef4\u62a4\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u5de5\u4f5c\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u8d39\u529b\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u4ece\u5176\u4ed6\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u6d3b\u52a8\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u91c7\u7528\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982API\u6f14\u53d8\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u8f6f\u4ef6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8865\u4e01\u8fc1\u79fb\uff09\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u62ec\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7ef4\u62a4\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u9879\u76ee\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6e90\u3001\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5339\u914d\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u81f3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee5\u53ca\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc1\u79fb\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8fd9\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6587\u4e2d\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u9047\u5230\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u5176\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5e0c\u671b\u6fc0\u52b1\u793e\u533a\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u5730\u63a2\u7d22\u8fd9\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u8fdb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7ef4\u62a4\u6240\u9700\u514b\u670d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

GitHub Actions, the CI/CD tool integrated into GitHub, allows repository maintainers to automate development workflows. We conducted a mixed methods analysis of GitHub Actions workflow changes over time. Through a preliminary qualitative analysis of 439 modified workflow files we identified seven types of conceptual changes to workflows. Next, we performed a quantitative analysis over 49K+ GitHub repositories totaling 267K+ workflow change histories and 3.4M+ workflow file versions from November 2019 to August 2025. This analysis revealed that repositories contain a median of three workflow files, and 7.3% of all workflow files are being changed every week. The changes made to workflows tend to be small, with about three-quarters containing only a single change.

However, existing Transformer-based recommendation models remain structurally fragmented, where sequence modeling and feature interaction are implemented as separate modules with independent parameterization. Such designs introduce a fundamental co-scaling challenge, as model capacity must be suboptimally allocated between dense feature interaction and sequence modeling under a limited computational budget. In this work, we propose MixFormer, a unified Transformer-style architecture tailored for recommender systems, which jointly models sequential behaviors and feature interactions within a single backbone. Through a unified parameterization, MixFormer enables effective co-scaling across both dense capacity and sequence length, mitigating the trade-off observed in decoupled designs. Moreover, the integrated architecture facilitates deep interaction between sequential and non-sequential representations, allowing high-order feature semantics to directly inform sequence aggregation and enhancing overall expressiveness. To ensure industrial practicality, we further introduce a user-item decoupling strategy for efficiency optimizations that significantly reduce redundant computation and inference latency. Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that MixFormer consistently exhibits superior accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, large-scale online A/B tests on two production recommender systems, Douyin and Douyin Lite, show consistent improvements in user engagement metrics, including active days and in-app usage duration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMixFormer\u7684\u7edf\u4e00Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u5e8f\u5217\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u662f\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\uff0c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6b21\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MixFormer\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u7edf\u4e00Transformer\u98ce\u683c\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5b83\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5171\u540c\u5efa\u6a21\u5e8f\u5217\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6237-\u9879\u76ee\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMixFormer\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5728\u7ebfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u751f\u4ea7\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6296\u97f3\u548c\u6296\u97f3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7248\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "MixFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5176\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u6269\u5c55\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Original available at https://is.ifmo.ru/disser/knyazev_autorefer.pdf", "summary": "This paper presents an automated method for classifying source code changes during the software development process based on clustering of change metrics. The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u66f4\u5ea6\u91cf\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528k-means\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u53d1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c06\u805a\u7c7b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee\uff08Subversion \u548c NHibernate\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7eaf\u5ea6\u548c\u71b5\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5ba1\u67e5\u6240\u9700\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bf9\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u6b65\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u5c06\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u66f4\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e86k-means\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u5ea6\u91cf\u5411\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6db5\u76d6\u4ee3\u7801\u884c\u6570\u3001\u5708\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u6587\u4ef6\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u63a5\u53e3\u53d8\u66f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u66f4\u7b4911\u4e2a\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e94\u4e2a\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u9879\u76ee(Subversion\u548cNHibernate)\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u4e3a0.05\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u7eaf\u5ea6P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05\uff0c\u71b5E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u66f4\u5ba1\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce and study $\u03b3$-weakly $\u03b8$-up-concavity, a novel first-order condition that characterizes a broad class of such functions. This condition provides a powerful unifying framework, strictly generalizing both DR-submodular functions and One-Sided Smooth (OSS) functions. Our central theoretical contribution demonstrates that $\u03b3$-weakly $\u03b8$-up-concave functions are upper-linearizable: for any feasible point, we can construct a linear surrogate whose gains provably approximate the original non-linear objective. This approximation holds up to a constant factor, namely the approximation coefficient, dependent solely on $\u03b3$, $\u03b8$, and the geometry of the feasible set. This linearizability yields immediate and unified approximation guarantees for a wide range of problems. Specifically, we obtain unified approximation guarantees for offline optimization as well as static and dynamic regret bounds in online settings via standard reductions to linear optimization. Moreover, our framework recovers the optimal approximation coefficient for DR-submodular maximization and significantly improves existing approximation coefficients for OSS optimization, particularly over matroid constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u03b3-\u5f31\u03b8-\u4e0a\u51f9\u6027\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u7c7b\u5355\u8c03\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u6761\u4ef6\u7edf\u4e00\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5355\u8fb9\u5e73\u6ed1\uff08OSS\uff09\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8eDR-\u6b21\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86OSS\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u62df\u9635\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u8c03\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u523b\u753b\u8fd9\u7c7b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u03b3-\u5f31\u03b8-\u4e0a\u51f9\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7edf\u4e00\u800c\u4e14\u4e25\u683c\u5730\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u51fd\u6570\u4e0eOSS\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5373\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u884c\u70b9\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u9020\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ebf\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u589e\u76ca\u53ef\u4ee5\u903c\u8fd1\u539f\u59cb\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u03b3-\u5f31\u03b8-\u4e0a\u51f9\u51fd\u6570\u786e\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u8bb8\u591a\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5728DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6709\u62df\u9635\u7ea6\u675f\u7684OSS\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e5f\u6709\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u6709\u529b\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f46\u4e0d\u9650\u4e8e\u79bb\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u53ca\u5728\u7ebf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5982DR-\u6b21\u6a21\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548cOSS\u4f18\u5316\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u89e3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Meeting those expectations hinges on an efficient retrieval stage that surfaces only the listings a guest might realistically book, before resource intensive ranking models are applied to determine the best results. Unlike many recommendation engines, our system faces a distinctive challenge, location retrieval, that sits upstream of ranking and determines which geographic areas are queried in order to filter inventory to a candidate set. The preexisting approach employs a deep bayesian bandit based system to predict a rectangular retrieval bounds area that can be used for filtering. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the methodology, challenges, and impact of rearchitecting search to retrieve from the subset of most bookable high precision rectangular map cells defined by dividing the world into 25M uniform cells.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Airbnb\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a2500\u4e07\u4e2a\u5747\u5300\u5355\u5143\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u6700\u53ef\u9884\u8ba2\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u77e9\u5f62\u5730\u56fe\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u5176\u641c\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "Airbnb\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u5168\u7403\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u623f\u6e90\u4f9b\u5e94\u4e0e\u5ba2\u4eba\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\uff08\u5982\u5730\u70b9\u3001\u8bbe\u65bd\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u9884\u671f\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u671f\u671b\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u5ba2\u4eba\u53ef\u80fd\u5b9e\u9645\u9884\u8ba2\u7684\u623f\u6e90\u3002\u4e0e\u8bb8\u591a\u63a8\u8350\u5f15\u64ce\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u6311\u6218\u2014\u2014\u4f4d\u7f6e\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u5b83\u4f4d\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u54ea\u4e9b\u5730\u7406\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u51fa\u5019\u9009\u623f\u6e90\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a2500\u4e07\u4e2a\u4e00\u81f4\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5355\u5143\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5355\u5143\u683c\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6700\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9884\u8ba2\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u77e9\u5f62\u533a\u57df\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u8fd9\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f3a\u76d7\u7b97\u6cd5\u9884\u6d4b\u77e9\u5f62\u68c0\u7d22\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cAirbnb\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4d\u7f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u641c\u7d22\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4ece\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u9884\u8ba2\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u7406\u5355\u5143\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cAirbnb\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6539\u5584\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002"}}

Automated Code Revision Tools Against Semantics-Preserving Perturbations", "comment": null, "summary": "Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u8ba2\uff08ACR\uff09\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u4ef7\u4f46\u5f62\u5f0f\u7565\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e5d\u79cd\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u7559\u6270\u52a8\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u771f\u5b9eGitHub\u9879\u76ee\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u76842032\u4e2aJava\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8d85\u8fc71\u4e07\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u7248\u672c\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e94\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684ACR\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6539\u52a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5de5\u5177\u6b63\u786e\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4e0b\u964d45.3%\u3002\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u51e0\u79cd\u51cf\u8f7b\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6536\u6548\u751a\u5fae\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u4fee\u8ba2(ACR)\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5373\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5185\u5728\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u8d28\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u9047\u5230\u8868\u8fbe\u76f8\u540c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f1a\u4f7f\u5f97\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u4e5f\u6709\u53ef\u80fd\u6536\u5230\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86ACR\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e5d\u79cd\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u6270\u52a8(SPP)\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6270\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6765\u81ea\u5b9e\u9645GitHub\u9879\u76ee\u76842032\u4e2aJava\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u7531\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc71\u4e07\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53d8\u52a8\u7248\u672c\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u6279\u53d8\u52a8\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6837\u4f8b\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e94\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684ACR\u5de5\u5177\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\u4f46\u5f62\u5f0f\u6709\u5f02\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u5904\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u8003\u5bdf\u7684ACR\u5de5\u5177\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u8ba2\u610f\u89c1\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e45.3%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u8d8a\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5219ACR\u5de5\u5177\u66f4\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u7ed9\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4fee\u8ba2\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u6d41\u7684ACR\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u7b49\u540c\u4f46\u8868\u9762\u5f62\u6001\u6709\u6240\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ACR\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f85\u89e3\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

Several recent studies have made an implicit assumption that feature representations can be inferred in some cases from singular vectors of attention matrices. However, sound justification for this assumption is lacking. In this paper we address that question, asking: why and when do singular vectors align with features? First, we demonstrate that singular vectors robustly align with features in a model where features can be directly observed. We then show theoretically that such alignment is expected under a range of conditions. We close by asking how, operationally, alignment may be recognized in real models where feature representations are not directly observable. We identify sparse attention decomposition as a testable prediction of alignment, and show evidence that it emerges in a manner consistent with predictions in real models. Together these results suggest that alignment of singular vectors with features can be a sound and theoretically justified basis for feature identification in language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd9\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7406\u7531\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e3a\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f55\u65f6\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4f1a\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9884\u671f\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5947\u5f02\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose a simple yet effective behavior feature boosting method that leverages substitute relationships among products (BFS). BFS identifies substitutes-products that satisfy similar user needs-and aggregates their behavioral signals (e.g., clicks, add-to-carts, purchases, and ratings) to provide a warm start for new items. Incorporating these enriched signals into ranking models mitigates cold-start effects and improves relevance and competitiveness. Experiments on a large E-commerce platform, both offline and online, show that BFS significantly improves search relevance and product discovery for cold-start products. BFS is scalable and practical, improving user experience while increasing exposure for newly launched items in E-commerce search.

However, studies featuring efficient and implementable quantum reservoir architectures along with model learning guarantees remain scarce in the literature. To close this gap, we introduce QuaRK, an end-to-end framework that couples a hardware-realistic quantum reservoir featurizer with a kernel-based readout scheme. Given a sequence of sample points, the reservoir injects the points one after the other to yield a compact feature vector from efficiently measured k-local observables using classical shadow tomography, after which a classical kernel-based readout learns the target mapping with explicit regularization and fast optimization. The resulting pipeline exposes clear computational knobs -- circuit width and depth as well as the measurement budget -- while preserving the flexibility of kernel methods to model nonlinear temporal functionals and being scalable to high-dimensional data. We further provide learning-theoretic generalization guarantees for dependent temporal data, linking design and resource choices to finite-sample performance, thereby offering principled guidance for building reliable temporal learners.

Experimental results on the MovieLens-1M, Foursquare-Tokyo, and Music4All-Onion datasets show that A2G-DiffRec is effective in enhancing item-side fairness at a marginal cost of accuracy reduction compared to existing guided diffusion recommenders and other non-diffusion baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edfA2G-DiffRec\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u6211\u5f15\u5bfc\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9879\u76ee\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u8f7b\u5fae\u727a\u7272\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u7387\u4e0d\u5747\u7b49\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86A2G-DiffRec\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "A2G-DiffRec\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u81ea\u8eab\u7248\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f31\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7531\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e0d\u540c\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u9879\u76ee\u95f4\u5e73\u8861\u66dd\u5149\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728MovieLens-1M\u3001Foursquare-Tokyo\u4ee5\u53caMusic4All-Onion\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u5668\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cA2G-DiffRec\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u7269\u54c1\u7aef\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "A2G-DiffRec\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9879\u76ee\u5c55\u793a\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u9700\u4e58\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u5904\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u9009\u53d6\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u751f\u6210\u964d\u7ef4\u5411\u91cf\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6240\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5411\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5f53\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u5219\u4f7f\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u672c\u8eab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u7a77\u4e3e\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5229\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u5f15\u7406\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ea4\u6362\u5df2\u9009\u548c\u672a\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u76f4\u5230\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u3002MNIST\u624b\u5199\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u964d\u7ef4\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5fc5\u4e0d\u53ef\u5c11\u7684\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\uff08PCA\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e58\u6cd5\u8fd0\u7b97\u672c\u8eab\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e58\u6cd5\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u6311\u9009\u90e8\u5206\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u964d\u7ef4\u3002\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5019\u9009\u5b50\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6839\u636e\u9009\u5b9a\u5143\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u5411\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u6790\u3002\u82e5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5219\u53ef\u91c7\u7528\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u8eab\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f62\u6210\u4ee5\u91cd\u5efa\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u7ec4\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u501f\u52a9\u77e9\u9635\u6c42\u9006\u5f15\u7406\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u56e0\u66ff\u6362\u7279\u5b9a\u5143\u7d20\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5b9e\u65bd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406MNIST\u624b\u5199\u6570\u5b57\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u964d\u7ef4\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u975e\u4e58\u6cd5\u578b\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u5143\u7d20\u9009\u62e9\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u964d\u7ef4\u3002"}}

CS researchers currently face two barriers: the lack of a unified framework for efficiently sharing contributions with the community, and the difficulty of deploying end-to-end prototypes needed for user evaluation. We introduce Orcheo, an open-source platform designed to bridge this gap. Orcheo offers three key advantages: (i) A modular architecture promotes component reuse through single-file node modules, facilitating sharing and reproducibility in CS research; (ii) Production-ready infrastructure bridges the prototype-to-system gap via dual execution modes, secure credential management, and execution telemetry, with built-in AI coding support that lowers the learning curve; (iii) Starter-kit assets include 50+ off-the-shelf components for query understanding, ranking, and response generation, enabling the rapid bootstrapping of complete CS pipelines. We describe the framework architecture and validate Orcheo's utility through case studies that highlight modularity and ease of use.

Code available at https://github.com/unseen1980/IDC", "summary": "Breaking long documents into smaller segments is a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. Whether for search engines, question-answering systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effective segmentation determines how well systems can locate and return relevant information. However, traditional methods, such as fixed-length or coherence-based segmentation, ignore user intent, leading to chunks that split answers or contain irrelevant noise. We introduce Intent-Driven Dynamic Chunking (IDC), a novel approach that uses predicted user queries to guide document segmentation. IDC leverages a Large Language Model to generate likely user intents for a document and then employs a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal chunk boundaries. This represents a novel application of DP to intent-aware segmentation that avoids greedy pitfalls. We evaluated IDC on six diverse question-answering datasets, including news articles, Wikipedia, academic papers, and technical documentation. IDC outperformed traditional chunking strategies on five datasets, improving top-1 retrieval accuracy by 5% to 67%, and matched the best baseline on the sixth. Additionally, IDC produced 40-60% fewer chunks than baseline methods while achieving 93-100% answer coverage. These results demonstrate that aligning document structure with anticipated information needs significantly boosts retrieval performance, particularly for long and heterogeneous documents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\uff08IDC\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7528\u6237\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cIDC\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7247\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u5207\u65ad\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u5305\u542b\u65e0\u5173\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6539\u5584\u8fd9\u4e00\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u7d22\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u641c\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u6587\u6863\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5206\u5757\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u5757\uff08IDC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8003\u8651\u5230\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8d2a\u5a6a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "IDC\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06top-1\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e865%\u523067%\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u7b2c\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u6301\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cIDC\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5757\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8640-60%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8693-100%\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u9884\u671f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u7bc7\u548c\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7684\u6587\u6863\u3002"}}

To mitigate these issues, we propose an interpretable clustering method based on optimal multiway-split decision trees, formulated as a 0-1 integer linear optimization problem. This reformulation renders the optimization problem more tractable compared to existing models. A key feature of our method is the integration of a one-dimensional K-means algorithm for the discretization of continuous variables, allowing for flexible and data-driven branching. Extensive numerical experiments on publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods in terms of clustering accuracy and interpretability.

This paper identifies and investigates a previously overlooked issue: benchmark data leakage in LLM-based recommendation. This phenomenon occurs when LLMs are exposed to and potentially memorize benchmark datasets during pre-training or fine-tuning, leading to artificially inflated performance metrics that fail to reflect true model performance. To validate this phenomenon, we simulate diverse data leakage scenarios by conducting continued pre-training of foundation models on strategically blended corpora, which include user-item interactions from both in-domain and out-of-domain sources. Our experiments reveal a dual-effect of data leakage: when the leaked data is domain-relevant, it induces substantial but spurious performance gains, misleadingly exaggerating the model's capability.

Informally, a time series chain is a temporally ordered set of subsequences, in which consecutive subsequences in the chain are similar to one another, but the last and the first subsequences maybe be dissimilar. Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series. To address this limitation, in this work, we introduce a new definition called \\textit{Joint Time Series Chain}, which is specially designed for the task of finding unexpected evolving trend across interrupted time series or two related time series. Our definition focuses on mitigating the robustness issues caused by the gap or interruption in the time series. We further propose an effective ranking criterion to identify the best chain. We demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing TSC work in locating unusual evolving patterns through extensive empirical evaluations. We further demonstrate the utility of our work with a real-life manufacturing application from Intel.

AlAd preserves local contextual semantics, enables flexible alignment across differing dimensionalities or architectures, and is entirely agnostic to the underlying compression method. AlAd can be deployed in two ways: as a plug-and-play module over a frozen compressed model, or by jointly fine-tuning AlAd with the compressed model for further performance gains. Through experiments on BERT-family models across three token-level NLP tasks, we demonstrate that AlAd significantly boosts the performance of compressed models with only marginal overhead in size and latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAlignment Adapter (AlAd)\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684token\u7ea7\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u538b\u7f29\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5982\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u914d\u5668\u2014\u2014Alignment Adapter(AlAd)\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u8de8\u8d8a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ecb\u7ecd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u540d\u4e3aAlignment Adapter\uff08AlAd\uff09\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684token\u7ea7\u522b\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u539f\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u3002AlAd\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5141\u8bb8\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5b89\u88c5\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03AlAd\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9BERT\u5bb6\u65cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5143\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAlAd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u5c11\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Alignment Adapter\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u538b\u7f29\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cdNLP\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Existing fairness approaches in FL primarily focus on equalizing loss or accuracy conditional on participation, implicitly assuming that clients have comparable opportunities to contribute over time. However, when participation itself is uneven, these objectives can lead to systematic under-representation of intermittently available clients, even if per-round performance appears fair. We propose cumulative utility parity, a fairness principle that evaluates whether clients receive comparable long-term benefit per participation opportunity, rather than per training round. To operationalize this notion, we introduce availability-normalized cumulative utility, which disentangles unavoidable physical constraints from avoidable algorithmic bias arising from scheduling and aggregation. Experiments on temporally skewed, non-IID federated benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially improves long-term representation parity, while maintaining near-perfect performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u7b49\u7684\u65b0\u516c\u5e73\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6839\u636e\u5176\u53c2\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6536\u76ca\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u548c\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u3001\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u957f\u671f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08FL\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u662f\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u7684\u3001\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u9650\u5236\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684FL\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u4e0e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u5931\u6216\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u9690\u542b\u5730\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u90fd\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u673a\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u53c2\u4e0e\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u5747\u5300\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u53ef\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6bcf\u8f6e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u7b49\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u662f\u5426\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u6b21\u53c2\u4e0e\u673a\u4f1a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u957f\u671f\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u53ef\u6297\u529b\u56e0\u7d20\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u4e0e\u56e0\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u805a\u5408\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53ef\u89c4\u907f\u7b97\u6cd5\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u3001\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u671f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u7b49\u539f\u5219\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7d2f\u79ef\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7531\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Zero-order (ZO) methods bypass backpropagation by estimating directional derivatives from forward evaluations, offering substantial memory savings. However, classical ZO estimators suffer from high variance and an adverse dependence on the parameter dimensionality $d$, which has constrained their use to low-dimensional problems. In this work, we propose a policy-driven ZO framework that treats the sampling distribution over perturbation directions as a learnable policy and updates it to reduce the variance of directional estimates. We develop a practical algorithm implementing this idea and provide a theoretical analysis, showing that learned sampling distributions improve the quality of gradient information and relax the explicit dependence on $d$ in convergence bounds. Empirically, we validate the approach on challenging LLM fine-tuning benchmarks, demonstrating substantially improved performance compared to standard ZO baselines. Our results suggest that adaptive direction sampling is a promising route to make ZO fine-tuning viable at scale.

This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate.

Sifting through these high-dimensional tradeoffs to infer the optimal patient-specific strategy is cognitively demanding and historically prone to variability. In this paper, we address this challenge within the context of High-Dose-Rate (HDR) brachytherapy for cervical cancer, where planning requires strictly managing radiation hot spots while balancing tumor coverage against organ sparing. We present ALMo (Aim-Limit-defined Multi-Objective system), an interactive decision support system designed to infer and operationalize clinician intent. ALMo employs a novel optimization framework that minimizes manual input through automated parameter setup and enables flexible control over toxicity risks. Crucially, the system allows clinicians to navigate the Pareto surface of dosimetric tradeoffs by directly manipulating intuitive aim and limit values. In a retrospective evaluation of 25 clinical cases, ALMo generated treatment plans that consistently met or exceeded manual planning quality, with 65% of cases demonstrating dosimetric improvements. Furthermore, the system significantly enhanced efficiency, reducing average planning time to approximately 17 minutes, compared to the conventional 30-60 minutes. While validated in brachytherapy, ALMo demonstrates a generalized framework for streamlining interaction in multi-criteria clinical decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aALMo\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7387\uff08HDR\uff09\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9650\u5236\u503c\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u4f18\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u3002ALMo\u5728\u56de\u987e\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6cbb\u7597\u8ba1\u5212\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd8\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u5242\u91cf\u7387\uff08HDR\uff09\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u591a\u79cd\u7ade\u4e89\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7406\u60f3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u4ed6\u4eec\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u65ad\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ALMo\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "ALMo\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u51cf\u5c11\u624b\u52a8\u8f93\u5165\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\u503c\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u6bd2\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e8\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf925\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u8bc4\u4ef7\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ALMo\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u59cb\u7ec8\u7b49\u4e8e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u624b\u5de5\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d65%\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5242\u91cf\u5b66\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea617\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u898130-60\u5206\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "ALMo\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8HDR\u5bab\u9888\u764c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u653e\u5c04\u6cbb\u7597\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While analytic learning enables rapid, recursive closed-form updates, its efficacy is often compromised by accumulated errors and feature incompatibility. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic study to dissect the failure modes of PTM-based analytic CIL, identifying representation rigidity as the primary bottleneck. Motivated by these insights, we propose \\textbf{VILA}, a novel dual-branch framework that advances analytic CIL via a two-level vision-language calibration strategy. Specifically, we coherently fuse plastic, task-adapted features with a frozen, universal semantic anchor at the feature level through geometric calibration, and leverage cross-modal priors at the decision level to rectify prediction bias. This confluence maintains analytic-learning's extreme efficiency while overcoming its inherent brittleness. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that VILA consistently yields superior performance, particularly in fine-grained and long-sequence scenarios. Our framework harmonizes high-fidelity prediction with the simplicity of analytic learning.

We establish a structural dichotomy between pseudometric and general weighted instances. On the positive side, we prove that the VC dimension of the clustering disagreement class is exactly $n{-}1$, yielding additive $\\varepsilon$-coresets of optimal size $\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$; that at most $\\binom{n}{2}$ triangle inequalities are active at any LP vertex, enabling an exact cutting-plane solver; and that a sparsified variant of LP-PIVOT, which imputes missing LP marginals via triangle inequalities, achieves a robust $\\frac{10}{3}$-approximation (up to an additive term controlled by an empirically computable imputation-quality statistic $\\overline\u0393_w$) once $\\tilde\u0398(n^{3/2})$ edges are observed, a threshold we prove is sharp. On the negative side, we show via Yao's minimax principle that without pseudometric structure, any algorithm observing $o(n)$ uniformly random edges incurs an unbounded approximation ratio, demonstrating that the pseudometric condition governs not only tractability but also the robustness of CC to incomplete information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316-\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4f2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u4f8b\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u52a0\u6743\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u6cd5\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6b67\u7c7b\u7684VC\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3an-1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7684LP-PIVOT\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u5927\u7ea6n^(3/2)\u6761\u8fb9\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u7a33\u5065\u768410/3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e5f\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6ca1\u6709\u4f2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u53ea\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230o(n)\u6761\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u754c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\uff08LP\uff09\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\uff08CC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u0398(n^3)\u4e2a\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d8\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5728\u4fdd\u6301LP\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c11\u8fb9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6b67\u7c7b\u7684VC\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7684LP-PIVOT\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u89d2\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u7f3a\u5931\u7684LP\u8fb9\u7f18\u6982\u7387\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528Yao\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u539f\u7406\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4f2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8fb9\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e\u4e00\u5b9a\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5219\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u5c06\u9762\u4e34\u65e0\u754c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7ea6n^(3/2)\u6761\u8fb9\u65f6\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u7684LP-PIVOT\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u768410/3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\uff08\u5916\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u53ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u9644\u52a0\u9879\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u4f2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8fb9\u6570\u5c11\u4e8eo(n)\uff0c\u5219\u4efb\u4f55\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u754c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bd4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u76f8\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4f2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5f71\u54cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Human evaluation is expensive, and LLM-as-judge approaches risk introducing hidden errors. Recent white-box methods detect contextual hallucinations using model internals, focusing on the localization of the attention mass, but two questions remain open: do these approaches extend to predicting answer correctness, and do they generalize out-of-domains? We introduce Head Entropy, a method that predicts answer correctness from attention entropy patterns, specifically measuring the spread of the attention mass. Using sparse logistic regression on per-head 2-Renyi entropies, Head Entropy matches or exceeds baselines in-distribution and generalizes substantially better on out-of-domains, it outperforms the closest baseline on average by +8.5% AUROC. We further show that attention patterns over the question/context alone, before answer generation, already carry predictive signal using Head Entropy with on average +17.7% AUROC over the closest baseline. We evaluate across 5 instruction-tuned LLMs and 3 QA datasets spanning general knowledge, multi-hop reasoning, and medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHead Entropy\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u524d\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898/\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c31\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5e38\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u6bb5\u8981\u4e48\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5b58\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u85cf\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff08\u5982\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\uff09\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5426\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Head Entropy\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5934\u76842-Renyi\u71b5\u6765\u5ea6\u91cf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u6280\u672f\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u9760\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u643a\u5e26\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHead Entropy\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5176\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e868.5%\u7684AUROC\u503c\u3002\u7279\u522b\u5730\uff0c\u5f53\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u5bf9\u624b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7ea617.7%\u7684AUROC\u3002", "conclusion": "Head Entropy\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9LLMs\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u3002"}}

While reducing weights to 1-bit precision through binarization can greatly improve efficiency, existing methods fail to narrow the distribution gap between binarized and full-precision weights, causing quantization errors to accumulate under long-horizon closed-loop execution and severely degrade actions. To fill this gap, we propose HBVLA, a VLA-tailored binarization framework. First, we use a policy-aware enhanced Hessian to identify weights that are truly critical for action generation. Then, we employ a sparse orthogonal transform for non-salient weights to induce a low-entropy intermediate state. Finally, we quantize both salient and non-salient weights in the Harr domain with group-wise 1-bit quantization. We have evaluated our approach on different VLAs: on LIBERO, quantized OpenVLA-OFT retains 92.2% of full-precision performance; on SimplerEnv, quantized CogAct retains 93.6%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art binarization methods. We further validate our method on real-world evaluation suite and the results show that HBVLA incurs only marginal success-rate degradation compared to the full-precision model, demonstrating robust deployability under tight hardware constraints. Our work provides a practical foundation for ultra-low-bit quantization of VLAs, enabling more reliable deployment on hardware-limited robotic platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aHBVLA\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u8fb9\u7f18\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3aHessian\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u54c8\u8fbe\u739b\u57df\u5185\u7ec4\u7ea71\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u5904\u7406\u975e\u663e\u8457\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u548cSimplerEnv\u7b49VLAs\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08VLA\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ca\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5c06\u6743\u91cd\u51cf\u5c11\u52301\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u95ed\u73af\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u964d\u4f4e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HBVLA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3aVLA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3aHessian\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u771f\u6b63\u5173\u952e\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u5173\u952e\u6743\u91cd\u5e94\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6b63\u4ea4\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4f4e\u71b5\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\uff1b\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u54c8\u8fbe\u739b\u57df\u5185\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u548c\u975e\u91cd\u8981\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec4\u7ea71\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIBERO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u7684OpenVLA-OFT\u4fdd\u7559\u4e8692.2%\u7684\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u800c\u5728SimplerEnv\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7684CogAct\u5219\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8693.6%\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e5f\u663e\u793aHBVLA\u76f8\u6bd4\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u6709\u8f7b\u5fae\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d85\u4f4e\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97VLA\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u8d44\u6e90\u6781\u5176\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u88ab\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5404\u7c7b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u3002"}}

While prior work has shown that models trained on smaller, high-quality datasets can outperform those trained on much larger but noisy or low-quality corpora, systematic methods for industrial-scale data selection in instruction tuning remain underexplored. In this work, we study instruction-tuning data selection through the lens of semantic representation similarity and identify a key limitation of state-of-the-art LLM encoders: they produce highly redundant semantic embeddings. To mitigate this redundancy, we propose Compressed Representation Data Selection (CRDS), a novel framework with two variants. CRDS-R applies Rademacher random projection followed by concatenation of transformer hidden-layer representations, while CRDS-W employs whitening-based dimensionality reduction to improve representational quality.

Current solutions are primarily constrained by two paradigms: Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), which improves short-term domain fitting but frequently disrupts previously learned global temporal patterns due to catastrophic forgetting; and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which incorporates external knowledge but introduces substantial retrieval overhead. This creates a severe scalability bottleneck that fails to meet the high-efficiency requirements of real-time stream processing. To break this impasse, we propose Memory for Time Series (MEMTS), a lightweight and plug-and-play method for retrieval-free domain adaptation in time series forecasting. The key component of MEMTS is a Knowledge Persistence Module (KPM), which internalizes domain-specific temporal dynamics, such as recurring seasonal patterns and trends into a compact set of learnable latent prototypes. In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations. This paradigm shift enables MEMTS to achieve accurate domain adaptation with constant-time inference and near-zero latency, while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting of general temporal patterns, all without requiring any architectural modifications to the frozen TSFM backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the SOTA performance of MEMTS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMemory for Time Series (MEMTS)\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u6a21\u5757(KPM)\u5185\u90e8\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68c0\u7d22\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSFMs\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5468\u671f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5982\u9886\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3(DAPT)\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u5df2\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u5219\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014Memory for Time\u7cfb\u5217(MEMTS)\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u6301\u4e45\u5316\u6a21\u5757(KPM)\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u8d8b\u52bf\u5185\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ec4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u539f\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u505a\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5c06\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u5bdf\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "MEMTS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb(SOTA)\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "MEMTS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684TSFM\u4e3b\u5e72\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e38\u6570\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u51e0\u4e4e\u96f6\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbe\u5230\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5730\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods frame anomaly detection as a purely discriminative prediction task with fixed feature inputs, rather than an evidence-driven diagnostic process. As a result, they often struggle when anomalies exhibit strong context dependence or diverse patterns. We argue that these limitations stem from the lack of adaptive feature preparation, reasoning-aware detection, and iterative refinement during inference. To address these challenges, we propose AnomaMind, an agentic time series anomaly detection framework that reformulates anomaly detection as a sequential decision-making process. AnomaMind operates through a structured workflow that progressively localizes anomalous intervals in a coarse-to-fine manner, augments detection through multi-turn tool interactions for adaptive feature preparation, and refines anomaly decisions via self-reflection. The workflow is supported by a set of reusable tool engines, enabling context-aware diagnostic analysis. A key design of AnomaMind is an explicitly designed hybrid inference mechanism for tool-augmented anomaly detection. In this mechanism, general-purpose models are responsible for autonomous tool interaction and self-reflective refinement, while core anomaly detection decisions are learned through reinforcement learning under verifiable workflow-level feedback, enabling task-specific optimization within a flexible reasoning framework.

While flow-based policies have recently proven effective in modeling complex action distributions with a fast deterministic sampling process, they still face a trade-off between expressiveness and computational burden, which is typically controlled by the number of flow steps. In this work, we propose mean velocity policy (MVP), a new generative policy function that models the mean velocity field to achieve the fastest one-step action generation. To ensure its high expressiveness, an instantaneous velocity constraint (IVC) is introduced on the mean velocity field during training.

Many SBI problems involve posteriors constrained by structured domains, such as bounded physical parameters or hybrid discrete-continuous variables, yet standard flow-matching methods typically operate in unconstrained spaces. This mismatch leads to inefficient learning and difficulty respecting physical constraints. Our contributions are twofold. First, generalizing the geometric inductive bias of CatFlow, we formalize endpoint-induced affine geometric confinement, a principle that incorporates domain geometry directly into the inference process via a two-sided variational model. This formulation improves numerical stability during sampling and leads to consistently better posterior fidelity, as demonstrated by improved classifier two-sample test performance across standard SBI benchmarks. Second, and more importantly, our variational parameterization enables SBI tasks involving discrete latent structure (e.g., switching systems) that are fundamentally incompatible with conventional flow-matching approaches. By addressing both geometric constraints and discrete latent structure, Pawsterior extends flow-matching to a broader class of structured SBI problems that were previously inaccessible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pawsterior\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff08SBI\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7aef\u70b9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4eff\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u57df\u51e0\u4f55\u7eb3\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684SBI\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f88\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u53d7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u6709\u754c\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u79bb\u6563-\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9075\u5b88\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63a8\u5e7f\u4e86CatFlow\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u6b63\u5f0f\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u7aef\u70b9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4eff\u5c04\u51e0\u4f55\u9650\u5236\u7684\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u8be5\u539f\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u8fb9\u53d8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u57df\u51e0\u4f55\u6574\u5408\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53d8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f7f\u5f97Pawsterior\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u90a3\u4e9b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3001\u6d89\u53ca\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684SBI\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u62bd\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u6807\u51c6SBI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u4ee5\u524d\u65e0\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u4e00\u7c7b\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316SBI\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\uff0cPawsterior\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u81f3\u5148\u524d\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7ed3\u6784\u5316SBI\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing CTM detectors construct test martingales by continually growing a reference set with each incoming sample, using it to assess how atypical the new sample is relative to past observations. While this design yields anytime-valid type-I error control, it suffers from test-time contamination: after a change, post-shift observations enter the reference set and dilute the evidence for distribution shift, increasing detection delay and reducing power.\n  In contrast, our method avoids contamination by design by comparing each new sample to a fixed null reference dataset. Our main technical contribution is a robust martingale construction that remains valid conditional on the null reference data, achieved by explicitly accounting for the estimation error in the reference distribution induced by the finite reference set. This yields anytime-valid type-I error control together with guarantees of asymptotic power one and bounded expected detection delay. Empirically, our method detects shifts faster than standard CTMs, providing a powerful and reliable distribution-shift detector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u6709\u6548\u7684I\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u529f\u7387\u4e3a\u4e00\u548c\u9884\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6709\u754c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7684CTMs\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684CTM\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u63a5\u6536\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u65ad\u6269\u5145\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53bb\u89c2\u5bdf\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u6709\u6548\u7684I\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u65e6\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u52a8\u540e\uff0c\u53d8\u52a8\u540e\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a00\u91ca\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u52a8\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u529f\u6548\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u96f6\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4ece\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u6280\u672f\u8d21\u732e\u5728\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9785\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u5230\u7531\u6709\u9650\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u9785\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u96f6\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f9d\u7136\u6709\u6548\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u523b\u6709\u6548\u7684I\u578b\u9519\u8bef\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u529f\u7387\u8fbe\u52301\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6709\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CTMs\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5feb\u901f\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5b83\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6c61\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \\texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \\texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \\textit{Demography, Age, Site \\& History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \\texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3asleep2vec\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u591c\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u91cf\u5b50\u96c6\u53ca\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e22\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u591c\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6cd5\u5219\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u5907\u6355\u83b7\u591c\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u7ed9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3asleep2vec\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ece42,249\u4e2a\u8fc7\u591c\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e5d\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528Demography\u3001Age\u3001Site & History-aware InfoNCE\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u7406\u548c\u91c7\u96c6\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u8bb0\u5f55\u5730\u70b9\uff09\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u52a0\u6743\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u7279\u5b9a\u961f\u5217\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u7761\u7720\u5206\u671f\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0csleep2vec\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e22\u5931\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u591c\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6cd5\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a0\u4e0a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591c\u95f4\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6807\u7b7e\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u901a\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability).

Empirical evidence shows that no forecasting model is universally dominant and that relative rankings vary across error metrics, demand regimes, and forecast horizons, generating ambiguity in multi-SKU decision contexts. This study proposes AHSIV (Adaptive Hybrid Selector for Intermittency and Variability), a horizon-aware and regime-conditioned model selection framework designed to address horizon-induced ranking instability. The proposed approach integrates scaled and absolute error metrics adjusted through a Metric Degradation by Forecast Horizon (MDFH) procedure, structural demand classification, multi-objective Pareto dominance, and hierarchical bias refinement within a unified decision architecture. The empirical evaluation is conducted on the Walmart, M3, M4, and M5 datasets under multiple train-test partition schemes and twelve-step forecasting horizons. Results indicate that AHSIV achieves statistical equivalence with the strongest monometric baseline in terms of aggregated performance while increasing the frequency of horizon-specific best-model selection. The findings demonstrate that model selection in heterogeneous demand environments cannot be treated as a static ranking problem, and that horizon-consistent, structurally adaptive mechanisms provide a principled, operationally coherent solution for multi-SKU forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aAHSIV\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6392\u540d\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Walmart\u3001M3\u3001M4\u548cM5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u9891\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5f3a\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5546\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u666e\u904d\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u4f1a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u591aSKU\u51b3\u7b56\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AHSIV\uff08\u9488\u5bf9\u95f4\u6b47\u6027\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6df7\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u72b6\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u9700\u6c42\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u52bf\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c42\u6b21\u504f\u5dee\u7ec6\u5316\u4e8e\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5212\u5206\u65b9\u6848\u53ca\u5341\u4e8c\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cAHSIV\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4e0e\u6700\u5f3a\u5355\u4e00\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fbe\u5230\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u9891\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u9700\u6c42\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u80fd\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u6392\u540d\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u800c\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u56f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4e3a\u591aSKU\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Prior work has shown promising results at scale in bringing this compression step inside the LLMs' architecture with heuristics to draw token boundaries, and also attempts to learn these token boundaries with straight-through estimates, which treat the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries as a continuous one. We show that these token boundaries can instead be learned using score function estimates, which have tighter theoretical guarantees due to directly optimizing the problem of drawing discrete token boundaries to minimize loss. We observe that techniques from reinforcement learning, such as time discounting, are necessary to reduce the variance of this score function sufficiently to make it practicable. We demonstrate that the resultant method outperforms prior proposed straight-through estimates, both qualitatively and quantitatively at the $100$ million parameter scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u5b66\u4e60LLM\u4e2d\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u7ed8\u5236\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6298\u6263\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u66f4\u52a0\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57281\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u76f4\u901a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5206\u8bcd\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u538b\u7f29\u6b65\u9aa4\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6b64\u538b\u7f29\u6b65\u9aa4\u5f15\u5165LLMs\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u5b9a\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5229\u7528\u76f4\u901a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5c06\u786e\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89c6\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\u5904\u7406\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5229\u7528\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u5904\u7406\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u76f4\u901a\u4f30\u8ba1\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u63a7\u5236\u5f97\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9047\u5230\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6765\u81ea\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6298\u6263\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff1a\u57281\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u4ece\u5b9a\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f4\u901a\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60LLM\u5185\u90e8\u7684\u5206\u8bcd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In practice, the environmental feedback is usually sparse and delayed. Learning from such signals is challenging, as LMs must implicitly infer how observed failures should translate into behavioral changes for future iterations. We introduce Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a training paradigm that embeds an explicit experience-reflection-consolidation loop into the reinforcement learning process. Given a task, the model generates an initial attempt, receives environmental feedback, and produces a reflection that guides a refined second attempt, whose success is reinforced and internalized into the base policy. This process converts feedback into structured behavioral revision, improving exploration and stabilizing optimization while preserving gains at deployment without additional inference cost. Across sparse-reward control environments and agentic reasoning benchmarks, ERL consistently improves learning efficiency and final performance over strong reinforcement learning baselines, achieving gains of up to +81% in complex multi-step environments and up to +11% in tool-using reasoning tasks. These results suggest that integrating explicit self-reflection into policy training provides a practical mechanism for transforming feedback into durable behavioral improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(ERL)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c-\u53cd\u601d-\u5de9\u56fa\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u9988\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u548c\u80fd\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cERL\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5ef6\u8fdf\u53cd\u9988\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9690\u5f0f\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u5982\u4f55\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u53d8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f53\u9a8c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(ERL)\u6765\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884c\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Experiential Reinforcement Learning (ERL)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7ecf\u9a8c-\u53cd\u601d-\u5de9\u56fa\u5faa\u73af\u76f4\u63a5\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u5c1d\u8bd5\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u6b65\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6240\u63a5\u6536\u5230\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53cd\u9988\u4ea7\u51fa\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u6307\u5bfc\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u66f4\u4e3a\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\uff1b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f1a\u88ab\u5f3a\u5316\u5e76\u5185\u5316\u81f3\u57fa\u7840\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u53ca\u6d89\u53ca\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u6280\u672f\uff0cERL\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe81%\u548c11%\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6574\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u5916\u90e8\u53cd\u9988\u4e3a\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, due to the autoregressive decoding nature of LLMs, the rollout process becomes the efficiency bottleneck of RL training, consisting of up to 70\\% of the total training time. In this work, we propose Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL) that uses a quantized actor for accelerating the rollout. We address two challenges in QuRL. First, we propose Adaptive Clipping Range (ACR) that dynamically adjusts the clipping ratio based on the policy ratio between the full-precision actor and the quantized actor, which is essential for mitigating long-term training collapse. Second, we identify the weight update problem, where weight changes between RL steps are extremely small, making it difficult for the quantization operation to capture them effectively. We mitigate this problem through the invariant scaling technique that reduces quantization noise and increases weight update. We evaluate our method with INT8 and FP8 quantization experiments on DeepScaleR and DAPO, and achieve 20% to 80% faster rollout during training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aQuantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL)\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u6267\u884c\u8005\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684rollout\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620%\u523080%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0crollout\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6210\u4e3a\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5360\u603b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u768470%\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuRL)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u91cf\u5316\u6267\u884c\u8005\u6765\u52a0\u5febrollout\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3QuRL\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662fAdaptive Clipping Range (ACR)\uff0c\u5b83\u6839\u636e\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u8005\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u6267\u884c\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u526a\u5207\u6bd4\u7387\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u957f\u671f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cf\u5316\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5e94\u5bf9\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728DeepScaleR\u548cDAPO\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884cINT8\u548cFP8\u91cf\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8620%\u523080%\u7684rollout\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "QuRL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u6267\u884c\u8005\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ACR\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f29\u653e\u6280\u672f\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f34\u968f\u800c\u6765\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u96be\u9898\u3002"}}

For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $\u03b1\\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $\u03b1$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $\u03b1$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $\u03b1^{1/2}\\log(1/\u03b1)$ for small $\u03b1$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $\u03b1$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives. We identify a non-Gaussian (Gibbs) limiting law under the correct scaling, which is validated numerically, and provide a corresponding pre-limit Wasserstein error bound.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7a33\u6001\u4e0e\u9002\u5f53\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u975e\u5747\u5300Berry-Esseen\u578b\u5c3e\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u754c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u7684SGD\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\uff08Gibbs\uff09\u6781\u9650\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6781\u9650Wasserstein\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5df2\u77e5\u968f\u7740\u6b65\u957f$\\alpha \\downarrow 0$\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u548c\u7f29\u653e\u540e\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u4f1a\u5f31\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684$\\alpha$\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f31\u6536\u655b\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e3a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7a33\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u660e\u786e\u3001\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u6027\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u6f02\u79fb\u6b63\u5219\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u77e9\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316-\u7f29\u653e\u7a33\u6001\u4e0e\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027SA\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9a\u7406\uff1a(1) \u5e73\u6ed1\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d(SGD)\uff0c(2) \u7ebf\u6027SA\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca(3) \u6536\u7f29\u975e\u7ebf\u6027SA\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d85\u51fa\u5f3a\u51f8\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u7684SGD\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u6240\u5448\u73b0\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\uff08Gibbs\uff09\u6781\u9650\u5f8b\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u7ef4\u6570\u548c\u6b65\u957f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u5c0f$\\alpha$\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0bWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9636\u4e3a$\\alpha^{1/2}\\log(1/\\alpha)$\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eWasserstein\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6bd4\u8f83\u7a33\u6001\u5c3e\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5c3e\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300Berry-Esseen\u578b\u5c3e\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u754c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u7684SGD\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\uff08Gibbs\uff09\u6781\u9650\u5f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u9884\u6781\u9650Wasserstein\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\u53ca\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5c3e\u90e8\u6982\u7387\u754c\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5373\u4e00\u822c\u51f8\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e5f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6781\u9650\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Although data-driven models can achieve accurate short-term forecasts, they often lack stability, interpretability, and scalability in regimes dominated by broadband or continuous spectra. Koopman-based approaches provide a principled linear perspective on nonlinear dynamics, but existing methods rely on restrictive finite-dimensional assumptions or explicit spectral parameterizations that degrade in high-dimensional settings. Against these issues, we introduce KoopGen, a generator-based neural Koopman framework that models dynamics through a structured, state-dependent representation of Koopman generators. By exploiting the intrinsic Cartesian decomposition into skew-adjoint and self-adjoint components, KoopGen separates conservative transport from irreversible dissipation while enforcing exact operator-theoretic constraints during learning. Across systems ranging from nonlinear oscillators to high-dimensional chaotic and spatiotemporal dynamics, KoopGen improves prediction accuracy and stability, while clarifying which components of continuous-spectrum dynamics admit interpretable and learnable representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aKoopGen\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecfKoopman\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684Koopman\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u4f20\u8f93\u4e0e\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u8017\u6563\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u6210\u5206\u662f\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4e14\u65f6\u7a7a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5728\u5bbd\u5e26\u6216\u8fde\u7eed\u5149\u8c31\u4e3b\u5bfc\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eKoopman\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7ef4\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86KoopGen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u795e\u7ecfKoopman\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u7684Koopman\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5185\u5728\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u5206\u89e3\u5c06\u659c\u81ea\u4f34\u968f\uff08skew-adjoint\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u4f34\u968f\uff08self-adjoint\uff09\u90e8\u5206\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u65bd\u52a0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4ece\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u632f\u8361\u5668\u5230\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6df7\u6c8c\u53ca\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cKoopGen\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e2d\u7684\u54ea\u4e9b\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u8d4b\u4e88\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "KoopGen\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u9ad8\u7ef4\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce EIDOS, a foundation model family that shifts pretraining from future value prediction to latent-space predictive learning. We train a causal Transformer to predict the evolution of latent representations, encouraging the emergence of structured and temporally coherent latent states. To ensure stable targets for latent-space learning, we design a lightweight aggregation branch to construct target representations. EIDOS is optimized via a joint objective that integrates latent-space alignment, observational grounding to anchor representations to the input signal, and direct forecasting supervision. On the GIFT-Eval benchmark, EIDOS mitigates structural fragmentation in the representation space and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this work, we introduce a simple yet powerful position encoding (PE) strategy, Random Float Sampling (RFS), that generalizes well to lengths unseen during pretraining or fine-tuning. In particular, instead of selecting position indices from a predefined discrete set, RFS uses randomly sampled continuous values, thereby avoiding out-of-distribution (OOD) issues on unseen lengths by exposing the model to diverse indices during training. Since assigning indices to tokens is a common and fundamental procedure in widely used PEs, the advantage of RFS can easily be incorporated into, for instance, the absolute sinusoidal encoding, RoPE, and ALiBi. Experiments corroborate its effectiveness by showing that RFS results in superior performance in length generalization tasks as well as zero-shot commonsense reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u968f\u673a\u6d6e\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff08RFS\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u503c\u800c\u975e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u957f\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRFS\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u957f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6d6e\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff08RFS\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u4f46\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u66fe\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6570\u636e\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916(OOD)\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RFS\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u4ee3\u66ff\u4ece\u56fa\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u96c6\u5408\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u65b9\u5f0f\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63a5\u89e6\u5230\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u56e0\u957f\u5ea6\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8303\u56f4\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cRFS\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f88\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u4e0e\u7edd\u5bf9\u6b63\u5f26\u7f16\u7801\u3001RoPE\u548cALiBi\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRFS\u5728\u5904\u7406\u672a\u77e5\u957f\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd8\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5e38\u8bc6\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u6d6e\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff08RFS\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u957f\u5ea6\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u53ca\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) alleviates this by restricting trainable parameters, yet most approaches still rely on cross-entropy (CE) loss, a surrogate for the 0-1 loss, to learn from new data. We revisit this choice and revive the true objective (0-1 loss) through a reinforcement learning perspective. By formulating classification as a one-step Markov Decision Process, we derive an Expected Policy Gradient (EPG) method that directly minimizes misclassification error with a low-variance gradient estimation. Our analysis shows that CE can be interpreted as EPG with an additional sample-weighting mechanism: CE encourages exploration by emphasizing low-confidence samples, while EPG prioritizes high-confidence ones. Building on this insight, we propose adaptive entropy annealing (aEPG), a training strategy that transitions from exploratory (CE-like) to exploitative (EPG-like) learning. aEPG-based methods outperform CE-based methods across diverse benchmarks and with various PEFT modules. More broadly, we evaluate various entropy regularization methods and demonstrate that lower entropy of the output prediction distribution enhances adaptation in pretrained vision models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565aEPG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3cCE\uff09\u8fc7\u6e21\u5230\u5f00\u53d1\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3cEPG\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u4ecd\u7136\u5bb9\u6613\u906d\u53d7\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u4e00\u6b65\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9884\u671f\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6(EPG)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee5\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9CE\u548cEPG\u4e4b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u71b5\u9000\u706b(aEPG)\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4e0e\u5f00\u53d1\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5f0f\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "result": "aEPG \u57fa\u4e8e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5404\u79cdPEFT\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eCE\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8f93\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u71b5\u8d8a\u4f4e\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u8d8a\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528aEPG\u8fd9\u6837\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf90-1\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7c7b\u589e\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches differentiate through the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system, but their computational cost and numerical robustness can degrade at scale. To address these limitations, we propose dXPP, a penalty-based differentiation framework that decouples QP solving from differentiation. In the solving step (forward pass), dXPP is solver-agnostic and can leverage any black-box QP solver. In the differentiation step (backward pass), we map the solution to a smooth approximate penalty problem and implicitly differentiate through it, requiring only the solution of a much smaller linear system in the primal variables. This approach bypasses the difficulties inherent in explicit KKT differentiation and significantly improves computational efficiency and robustness. We evaluate dXPP on various tasks, including randomly generated QPs, large-scale sparse projection problems, and a real-world multi-period portfolio optimization task.

Existing methods face notable limitations: GRPO samples exclusively from the root, saturating high-probability trajectories while leaving deep, error-prone states under-explored. Tree-based methods blindly disperse budgets across trivial or unrecoverable states, causing sampling dilution that fails to uncover rare correct suffixes and destabilizes local baselines. To address this, we propose Deep Dense Exploration (DDE), a strategy that focuses exploration on $\\textit{pivots}$-deep, recoverable states within unsuccessful trajectories. We instantiate DDE with DEEP-GRPO, which introduces three key innovations: (1) a lightweight data-driven utility function that automatically balances recoverability and depth bias to identify pivot states; (2) local dense resampling at each pivot to increase the probability of discovering correct subsequent trajectories; and (3) a dual-stream optimization objective that decouples global policy learning from local corrective updates.

The benchmark uses controlled needle insertion by embedding short activity bouts into longer longitudinal accelerometer recordings, enabling systematic evaluation across context lengths ranging from seconds to 2 hours per sample. We hypothesize that existing TSLM time series encoders overlook temporal granularity as context length increases, creating a task-dependent effect: compression aids classification but impairs retrieval of localized events. Across multiple model and encoding strategies, we observe a consistent divergence between classification and retrieval behavior. Learned latent compression preserves or improves classification accuracy at compression ratios up to 176$\\times$, but retrieval performance degrades with context length, incurring in the loss of temporally localized information. These results highlight the importance of architectural designs that decouple sequence length from computational complexity while preserving temporal fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86TS-Haystack\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65f6\u95f4\u68c0\u7d22\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u589e\u52a0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\u95f4\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08TSLMs\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u672a\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u8fd9\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aTS-Haystack\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u56db\u5927\u7c7b\u5341\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u77ed\u6d3b\u52a8\u7247\u6bb5\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u66f4\u957f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u8ba1\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u9ad8\u8fbe176\u500d\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6027\u80fd\u5374\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u65f6\u95f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5206\u79bb\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u68c0\u7d22\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that the functional scaling law (FSL) framework introduced in Li et al. (2025a) provides a principled lens for analyzing BSS. Specifically, we characterize the optimal BSS under a fixed data budget and show that its structure depends sharply on task difficulty. For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty. Crucially, this effect implies that large batches can be safely deferred to late training without sacrificing performance, while substantially reducing data consumption. Finally, extensive LLM pretraining experiments -- covering both Dense and MoE architectures with up to 1.1B parameters and 1T tokens -- validate our theoretical predictions. Across all settings, late-switch schedules consistently outperform constant-batch and early-switch baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b(FSL)\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6(BSS)\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f73BSS\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u540e\u671f\u5207\u6362\u5230\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u529f\u80fd\u7f29\u653e\u5b9a\u5f8b\uff08FSL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u6613\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u8ffd\u8d76\u6548\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u671f\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u8f6c\u5411\u5927\u6279\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u589e\u52a0\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\uff1b\u800c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u56f0\u96be\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5219\u5e94\u5728\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u540e\u671f\u624d\u8f6c\u6362\u81f3\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f7f\u7528FSL\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790BSS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u8c03\u5ea6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8282\u7701\u6570\u636e\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While dynamic sparse attention has been actively explored, existing methods designed for autoregressive LLMs rely on approximate importance estimation and perform poorly when adapted to block diffusion. This work identifies a key opportunity unique to block diffusion: attention at the first All-[MASK] denoising step reliably predicts important KV entries and budget requirements, enabling MAGE to perform a single exact attention pass per block and reuse it for training-free sparse denoising. Across long-context benchmarks including LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack, MAGE achieves near-lossless accuracy with a fraction of the KV budget while delivering up to 3-4x end-to-end speedup, consistently outperforming AR-oriented sparse attention baselines. A lightweight fine-tuning strategy further strengthens [MASK]-guided patterns with minimal cost, requiring only a few hours of training on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU for both 1.5B and 7B models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faMAGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5757\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9996\u6b21[MASK]\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u8981KV\u6761\u76ee\u548c\u9884\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4e4e\u65e0\u635f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11KV\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a[MASK]\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5757\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7531\u4e8eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u8bbf\u95ee\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5757\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "MAGE\u5229\u7528\u5757\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u5168[MASK]\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\u5c31\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u7684KV\u6761\u76ee\u53ca\u9884\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ea\u9700\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u91cd\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u53bb\u566a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86[MASK]\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMAGE\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u635f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4eKV\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe3-4\u500d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u52a0\u901f\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e1.5B\u548c7B\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5355\u4e2aNVIDIA H100 GPU\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "conclusion": "MAGE\u4e3a\u5757\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86KV\u7f13\u5b58\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We propose Robust Multi-Task Boosting using Clustering and Local Ensembling (RMB-CLE), a principled MTL framework that integrates error-based task clustering with local ensembling. Unlike prior work that assumes fixed clusters or hand-crafted similarity metrics, RMB-CLE derives inter-task similarity directly from cross-task errors, which admit a risk decomposition into functional mismatch and irreducible noise, providing a theoretically grounded mechanism to prevent negative transfer. Tasks are grouped adaptively via agglomerative clustering, and within each cluster, a local ensemble enables robust knowledge sharing while preserving task-specific patterns. Experiments show that RMB-CLE recovers ground-truth clusters in synthetic data and consistently outperforms multi-task, single-task, and pooling-based ensemble methods across diverse real-world and synthetic benchmarks. These results demonstrate that RMB-CLE is not merely a combination of clustering and boosting but a general and scalable framework that establishes a new basis for robust multi-task learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6RMB-CLE\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u907f\u514d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u906d\u53d7\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RMB-CLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u9519\u8bef\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u51dd\u805a\u5f0f\u805a\u7c7b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u7ec4\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u96c6\u7fa4\u5185\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0aRMB-CLE\u80fd\u591f\u6062\u590d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7c07\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u53ca\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c60\u5316\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cRMB-CLE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RMB-CLE\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Finance-specific biases can inflate performance, contaminate backtests, and make reported results useless for any deployment claim. We identify five recurring biases in financial LLM applications. They include look-ahead bias, survivorship bias, narrative bias, objective bias, and cost bias. These biases break financial tasks in distinct ways and they often compound to create an illusion of validity. We reviewed 164 papers from 2023 to 2025 and found that no single bias is discussed in more than 28 percent of studies. This position paper argues that bias in financial LLM systems requires explicit attention and that structural validity should be enforced before any result is used to support a deployment claim. We propose a Structural Validity Framework and an evaluation checklist with minimal requirements for bias diagnosis and future system design.

Adapting production to actual household needs requires accurate forecasting of hot water demand to ensure comfort and, most importantly, to reduce energy waste. However, the conventional approach of training separate machine learning models for each household becomes computationally expensive at scale, particularly in cloud-connected HP deployments.\n  This study introduces DELTAiF, a transfer learning (TL) based framework that provides scalable and accurate prediction of household hot water consumption. By predicting large hot water usage events, such as showers, DELTAiF enables adaptive yet scalable hot water production at the household level. DELTAiF leverages learned knowledge from a representative household and fine-tunes it across others, eliminating the need to train separate machine learning models for each HP installation. This approach reduces overall training time by approximately 67 percent while maintaining high predictive accuracy values between 0.874 and 0.991, and mean absolute percentage error values between 0.001 and 0.017. The results show that TL is particularly effective when the source household exhibits regular consumption patterns, enabling hot water demand forecasting at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6DELTAiF\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5bb6\u5ead\u70ed\u6c34\u6d88\u8017\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u5176\u4ed6\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70ed\u6cf5\u5b89\u88c5\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5927\u5927\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u7ea667%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff080.874\u81f30.991\u4e4b\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u503c\uff080.001\u81f30.017\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4f4f\u5b85\u70ed\u6cf5\u5b89\u88c5\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8fc5\u901f\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5bb6\u5ead\u70ed\u6c34\u751f\u4ea7\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6280\u672f\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u70ed\u6c34\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8212\u9002\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u80fd\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e91\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u70ed\u6cf5\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86DELTAiF\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\uff08TL\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u70ed\u6c34\u6d88\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u3002DELTAiF\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5927\u578b\u70ed\u6c34\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u6dcb\u6d74\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb6\u5ead\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u70ed\u6c34\u751f\u4ea7\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5bb6\u5ead\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8c03\u6574\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5bb6\u5ead\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u70ed\u6cf5\u5b89\u88c5\u5355\u72ec\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5927\u7ea667%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4ecb\u4e8e0.874\u52300.991\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u503c\u4ee5\u53ca0.001\u52300.017\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u8bef\u5dee\u503c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u6e90\u5bb6\u5ead\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u65f6\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u522b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70ed\u6c34\u9700\u6c42\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DELTAiF\u6846\u67b6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bb6\u5ead\u70ed\u6c34\u6d88\u8017\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5f8b\u6027\u6d88\u8d39\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u8282\u80fd\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead\u70ed\u6c34\u4f9b\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We prove that Radial-VCReg transforms a broader class of distributions towards normality compared to VCReg and show on synthetic and real-world datasets that it consistently improves performance by reducing higher-order dependencies and promoting more diverse and informative representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5Radial-VCReg\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f84\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\u635f\u5931\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8303\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5VCReg\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982VCReg\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u8303\u4e00\u9636\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Radial-VCReg\uff0c\u5728VCReg\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f84\u5411\u9ad8\u65af\u5316\u635f\u5931\u9879\uff0c\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u9879\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7279\u5f81\u8303\u6570\u4e0e\u5361\u65b9\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u2014\u2014\u8fd9\u662f\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fd8\u662f\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRadial-VCReg\u90fd\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u9636\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5177\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Radial-VCReg\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u63a8\u5411\u6b63\u6001\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Abdelmoniem", "Geyong Min", "Haojun Huang", "Jiwei Huang"], "title": "DeepFusion: Accelerating MoE Training via Federated Knowledge Distillation from Heterogeneous Edge Devices", "comment": "Index Terms: Large language models, Mixture-of-experts, Federated knowledge distillation, Edge device heterogeneity", "summary": "Recent Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) such as Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE are transforming generative AI in natural language processing. However, these models require vast and diverse training data. Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by leveraging private data from heterogeneous edge devices for privacy-preserving MoE training. Nonetheless, traditional FL approaches require devices to host local MoE models, which is impractical for resource-constrained devices due to large model sizes. To address this, we propose DeepFusion, the first scalable federated MoE training framework that enables the fusion of heterogeneous on-device LLM knowledge via federated knowledge distillation, yielding a knowledge-abundant global MoE model. Specifically, DeepFusion features each device to independently configure and train an on-device LLM tailored to its own needs and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we propose a novel View-Aligned Attention (VAA) module that integrates multi-stage feature representations from the global MoE model to construct a predictive perspective aligned with on-device LLMs, thereby enabling effective cross-architecture knowledge distillation. By explicitly aligning predictive perspectives, VAA resolves the view-mismatch problem in traditional federated knowledge distillation, which arises from heterogeneity in model architectures and prediction behaviors between on-device LLMs and the global MoE model. Experiments with industry-level MoE models (Qwen-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE) and real-world datasets (medical and finance) demonstrate that DeepFusion achieves performance close to centralized MoE training. Compared with key federated MoE baselines, DeepFusion reduces communication costs by up to 71% and improves token perplexity by up to 5.28%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DeepFusion\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u878d\u5408\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u5230\u5168\u5c40Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) \u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aView-Aligned Attention (VAA) \u7684\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86token\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eMixture-of-Experts (MoE) \u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u6c42\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u5907\u90fd\u6258\u7ba1\u672c\u5730MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u6765\u8bf4\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86DeepFusion\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u5907\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u8eab\u6761\u4ef6\u914d\u7f6e\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6574\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5168\u5c40MoE\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "DeepFusion\u5141\u8bb8\u6bcf\u53f0\u8bbe\u5907\u72ec\u7acb\u5730\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u5408\u81ea\u5df1\u9700\u6c42\u53ca\u786c\u4ef6\u9650\u5236\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684View-Aligned Attention (VAA) \u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u6765\u81ea\u5168\u5c40MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u521b\u5efa\u51fa\u4e0e\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e1a\u7ea7MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen-MoE \u548c DeepSeek-MoE\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u533b\u7597\u548c\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\uff09\uff0cDeepFusion \u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316MoE\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u8054\u90a6MoE\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cDeepFusion \u6700\u591a\u53ef\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c1171%\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06token\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u6700\u591a5.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepFusion \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A Perspective on Transformer Architecture Failure Modes", "comment": "46 pages, 34 Figures", "summary": "Transformer architectures have revolutionized machine learning across a wide range of domains, from natural language processing to scientific computing. However, their growing deployment in high-stakes applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing, healthcare, autonomous systems, and critical areas of scientific computing including climate modeling, materials discovery, drug discovery, nuclear science, and robotics, necessitates a deeper and more rigorous understanding of their trustworthiness. In this work, we critically examine the foundational question: \\textitHow trustworthy are transformer models?} We evaluate their reliability through a comprehensive review of interpretability, explainability, robustness against adversarial attacks, fairness, and privacy. We systematically examine the trustworthiness of transformer-based models in safety-critical applications spanning natural language processing, computer vision, and science and engineering domains, including robotics, medicine, earth sciences, materials science, fluid dynamics, nuclear science, and automated theorem proving; highlighting high-impact areas where these architectures are central and analyzing the risks associated with their deployment. By synthesizing insights across these diverse areas, we identify recurring structural vulnerabilities, domain-specific risks, and open research challenges that limit the reliable deployment of transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5730\u5ba1\u89c6\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u9762\u56de\u987e\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8bf8\u5982\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u548c\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u5206\u6790Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u53ca\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u5730\u7403\u79d1\u5b66\u7b49\uff09\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u4ee5\u53ca\u9650\u5236Transformer\u53ef\u9760\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u5c31\uff0c\u4f46\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u4fe1\u4efb\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bf8\u591a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Among existing approaches, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is widely used, especially for RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR) fine-tuning. In GRPO, each query prompts the LLM to generate a group of rollouts with a fixed group size $N$. When all rollouts in a group share the same outcome, either all correct or all incorrect, the group-normalized advantages become zero, yielding no gradient signal and wasting fine-tuning compute. We introduce Adaptive Efficient Rollout Optimization (AERO), an enhancement of GRPO. AERO uses an adaptive rollout strategy, applies selective rejection to strategically prune rollouts, and maintains a Bayesian posterior to prevent zero-advantage dead zones. Across three model configurations (Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, Qwen2.5-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct), AERO improves compute efficiency without sacrificing performance. Under the same total rollout budget, AERO reduces total training compute by about 48% while shortening wall-clock time per step by about 45% on average.

Notably, on the challenging Humanoid-run task, WIMLE improves sample efficiency by over $50$\\% relative to the strongest competitor, and on HumanoidBench it solves $8$ of $14$ tasks (versus $4$ for BRO and $5$ for SimbaV2).

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity. We validate our theoretical bounds with numerical experiments, demonstrating that it reliably tracks and predicts the behavior of the true generalization gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u53d8\u6362\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u754c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9879\uff1a1) \u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b2) \u6d4b\u91cf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u9879\uff1b3) \u6355\u6349\u589e\u5f3a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u9879\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7fa4\u76f4\u5f84\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u754c\u9650\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u7fa4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u73b0\u4ee3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bd5\u56fe\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u8fb9\u754c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89c6\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u53d8\u6362\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u8f68\u9053\u5e73\u5747\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u5728\u5bf9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u589e\u5f3a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u505a\u51fa\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u2018\u7fa4\u76f4\u5f84\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6240\u80fd\u9020\u6210\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u7fa4\u76f4\u5f84\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u53ef\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9e\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80cc\u540e\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u2018\u7fa4\u76f4\u5f84\u2019\u8fd9\u4e00\u6982\u5ff5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

Machine learning-based classifiers trained on tabular data have been recently used to make faster decisions on these prospects. The lack of transparency in the decision-making processes of such models has led to the emergence of explainable AI (XAI). LIME and SHAP are two such examples of these XAI methods which try to generate explanations of a particular decision by ranking the input features in terms of importance. However, explanations of the same scenario generated by these two different explanation strategies have shown to disagree or be different, particularly for complex data. This is because the definitions of \"importance\" and \"relevance\" differ for different explanation strategies. Thus, grounding these ranked features using theoretically backed causal ideas of necessity and sufficiency can prove to be a more reliable and robust way to improve the trustworthiness of the concerned explanation strategies.We propose a unified framework to generate counterfactuals as well as quantify necessity and sufficiency and use these to perform a robustness evaluation of the explanations provided by LIME and SHAP on high dimensional structured prospect risking data.

We empirically observe that outlier severity intensifies with pre-training scale (e.g., progressing from CLIP to the more extensively trained SigLIP and SigLIP2). Through theoretical analysis as well as empirical correlation studies, we establish the direct link between these activation outliers and dominant singular values of the weights. Building on this insight, we propose Selective Spectral Decay ($S^2D$), a geometrically-principled conditioning method that surgically regularizes only the weight components corresponding to the largest singular values during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $S^2D$ significantly reduces activation outliers and produces well-conditioned representations that are inherently quantization-friendly. Models trained with $S^2D$ achieve up to 7% improved PTQ accuracy on ImageNet under W4A4 quantization and 4% gains when combined with QAT. These improvements also generalize across downstream tasks and vision-language models, enabling the scaling of increasingly large and rigorously trained models without sacrificing deployment efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\uff08$S^2D$\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5730\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff08\u5982\u4eceCLIP\u5230\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SigLIP\u548cSigLIP2\uff09\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u95ee\u9898\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u52a0\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u53ca\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e0e\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8c31\u8870\u51cf($S^2D$)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "$S^2D$\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u6613\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528$S^2D$\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728W4A4\u91cf\u5316\u4e0bImageNet\u4e0a\u7684PTQ\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e867%\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408QAT\u65f6\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u59164%\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e5f\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528$S^2D$\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e14\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e25\u683c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56e0\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We propose Selective Synchronization Attention (SSA), a novel attention mechanism that replaces the standard dot-product self-attention with a closed-form operator derived from the steady-state solution of the Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators. In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight. This formulation provides three key advantages: (i) natural sparsity arising from the phase-locking threshold, whereby tokens with incompatible frequencies automatically receive zero attention weight without explicit masking; (ii) unified positional-semantic encoding through the natural frequency spectrum, eliminating the need for separate positional encodings; and (iii) a single-pass, closed-form computation that avoids iterative ODE integration, with all components (coupling, order parameter, synchronization) derived from the oscillatory framework. We instantiate SSA within the Oscillatory Synchronization Network (OSN), a drop-in replacement for the Transformer block.

Training-free activation sparsity is a promising approach for efficient LLM inference, yet existing methods often rely solely on activation information and uniform sparsity ratios. This overlooks the critical interplay with weights and inter-block sensitivity variation, leading to suboptimal performance. We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error.

Despite notable advances in recent decades, the lack of high-quality data and the reliance of traditional causal discovery algorithms (TCDA) on the assumption of no latent confounders, as well as their tendency to overlook the precise semantics of latent variables, have long been major obstacles to the broader application of causal discovery. To address this issue, we propose a novel causal modeling framework, TLVD, which integrates the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with the data-driven modeling capabilities of TCDA for inferring latent variables and their semantics. Specifically, we first employ a data-driven approach to construct a causal graph that incorporates latent variables. Then, we employ multi-LLM collaboration for latent variable inference, modeling this process as a game with incomplete information and seeking its Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) to infer the possible specific latent variables. Finally, to validate the inferred latent variables across multiple real-world web-based data sources, we leverage LLMs for evidence exploration to ensure traceability. We comprehensively evaluate TLVD on three de-identified real patient datasets provided by a hospital and two benchmark datasets.

While parameter synchronization guarantees numerical equivalence of model weights after each iteration, it does not necessarily imply alignment of worker-level optimization dynamics before gradient aggregation. This paper identifies and studies this latent mismatch, termed \\emph{silent inconsistency}, where cross-worker divergence in losses and gradients can remain invisible under conventional aggregated monitoring signals. We propose a lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic framework that quantifies worker-level consistency using training signals readily available in standard pipelines. Specifically, we introduce three complementary metrics: loss dispersion, gradient-norm dispersion, and gradient-direction consistency measured by inter-worker cosine similarity. The proposed metrics incur negligible overhead and require no modification to model architecture, synchronization mechanisms, or optimization algorithms. We validate the framework by fully fine-tuning the 1B-parameter \\texttt{openPangu-Embedded-1B-V1.1} model on the \\texttt{tatsu-lab/alpaca} dataset using an 8-NPU DP setup, under controlled perturbations of cross-rank stochasticity. Experimental results show that progressively desynchronized data shuffling and random seeds lead to substantial increases in loss/gradient dispersion and reduced directional alignment, despite smooth globally averaged loss curves.

Nevertheless, this process can introduce excessively long responses, inflating inference latency and computational overhead. Prior length-control approaches typically rely on fixed heuristic reward shaping, which can misalign with the task objective and require brittle tuning. In this work, we propose LACONIC, a reinforcement learning method that enforces a target token budget during training. Specifically, we update policy models using an augmented objective that combines the task reward with a length-based cost. To balance brevity and task performance, the cost scale is adaptively adjusted throughout training. This yields robust length control while preserving task reward. We provide a theoretical guarantee that support the method. Across mathematical reasoning models and datasets, LACONIC preserves or improves pass@1 while reducing output length by over 50%. It maintains out-of-domain performance on general knowledge and multilingual benchmarks with 44% fewer tokens. Moreover, LACONIC integrates into standard RL-tuning with no inference changes and minimal deployment overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLACONIC\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5956\u52b1\u9a71\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8fc7\u957f\u54cd\u5e94\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc7\u957f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "method": "LACONIC\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u8c03\u6574\u6210\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "LACONIC\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8pass@1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc750%\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u901a\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u752844%\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ef4\u6301\u4e86\u57df\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6RL\u8c03\u4f18\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LACONIC\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The learner's objective is standard MAB regret minimization, with the additional complexity of adaptively selecting which data source to query from at each round. We propose Source-Optimistic Adaptive Regret minimization (SOAR), a novel algorithm that quickly prunes high-variance sources using sharp variance-concentration bounds, followed by a `balanced min-max LCB-UCB approach' that seamlessly integrates the parallel tasks of identifying the best arm and the optimal (minimum-variance) data source. Our analysis shows SOAR achieves an instance-dependent regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left({\u03c3^*}^2\\sum_{i=2}^K \\frac{\\log T}{\u0394_i} + \\sqrt{K \\sum_{j=1}^M \u03c3_j^2}\\right)$, up to preprocessing costs depending only on problem parameters, where ${\u03c3^*}^2 := \\min_j \u03c3_j^2$ is the minimum source variance and $\u0394_i$ denotes the suboptimality gap of the $i$-th arm. This result is both surprising as despite lacking prior knowledge of the minimum-variance source among $M$ alternatives, SOAR attains the optimal instance-dependent regret of standard single-source MAB with variance ${\u03c3^*}^2$, while incurring only an small (and unavoidable) additive cost of $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{K \\sum_{j=1}^M \u03c3_j^2})$ towards the optimal (minimum variance) source identification. Our theoretical bounds represent a significant improvement over some proposed baselines, e.g. Uniform UCB or Explore-then-Commit UCB, which could potentially suffer regret scaling with $\u03c3_{\\max}^2$ in place of ${\u03c3^*}^2$-a gap that can be arbitrarily large when $\u03c3_{\\max} \\gg \u03c3^*$.

However, existing PEFT methods mainly operate in Euclidean space, fundamentally limiting their capacity to capture complex geometric structures inherent in language data. While alternative geometric spaces, like hyperbolic geometries for hierarchical data and spherical manifolds for circular patterns, offer theoretical advantages, forcing representations into a single manifold type ultimately limits expressiveness, even when curvature parameters are learnable. To address this, we propose Mixture of Space (MoS), a unified framework that leverages multiple geometric spaces simultaneously to learn richer, curvature-aware representations. Building on this scheme, we develop MoSLoRA, which extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with heterogeneous geometric experts, enabling models to dynamically select or combine appropriate geometric spaces based on input context. Furthermore, to address the computational overhead of frequent manifold switching, we develop a lightweight routing mechanism. Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how curvature optimization impacts training stability and model performance. Our experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MoSLoRA consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 5.6% improvement on MATH500 and 15.9% on MAWPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMixture of Space (MoS)\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u5177\u6709\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MoSLoRA\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f02\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u4e13\u5bb6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6216\u7ed3\u5408\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u6d41\u5f62\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u66f2\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c1\u89e3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMoSLoRA\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03(PEFT)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u5982\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7403\u9762\u6d41\u5f62\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u8868\u793a\u5f3a\u5236\u5f52\u5165\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u8868\u8fbe\u529b\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Mixture of Space (MoS)\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u66f2\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8eMoS\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MoSLoRA\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5f02\u6784\u51e0\u4f55\u4e13\u5bb6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u52a8\u6001\u5730\u9009\u53d6\u6216\u7ec4\u5408\u5408\u9002\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u7f13\u89e3\u7531\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u5207\u6362\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u6240\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cMoSLoRA\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0c\u5728MATH500\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.6%\uff0c\u800c\u5728MAWPS\u4e0a\u5219\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8615.9%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u66f2\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u6574\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "Mixture of Space (MoS)\u53ca\u5176\u5e94\u7528MoSLoRA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u6280\u672f\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u51e0\u4f55\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cMoSLoRA\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

GLUs have piecewise quadratic functional forms that are sufficient to exhibit quadratic order of approximation. Our key contribution is to demonstrate that the $L(P)$ scaling slope is $L(P)\\propto P^{-3}$ for GLUs but only $L(P)=P^{-2}$ for MLPs on function reconstruction problems. We provide a parameter construction and empirical verification of these slopes for 1D function approximation. From the first principles we discover, we make one stride and propose the ``Gated Quadratic Unit'' which has an even steeper $L(P)$ slope than the GLU and MLP. This opens the possibility of architecture design from first principles numerical theory to unlock superior scaling in large models.

Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical \"Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)\" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings.

We consider a non-stationary environment that subsumes both stochastic and adversarial models and where, at each round, both losses and constraints are drawn from distributions that may change arbitrarily over time. In such a setting, it is provably not possible to guarantee both sublinear regret and sublinear violation. Accordingly, prior work has mainly focused either on settings with stochastic constraints or on relaxing the benchmark with fully adversarial constraints (\\emph{e.g.}, via competitive ratios with respect to the optimum). We provide the first algorithms that achieve optimal rates of regret and \\emph{positive} constraint violation when the constraints are stochastic while the losses may vary arbitrarily, and that simultaneously yield guarantees that degrade smoothly with the degree of adversariality of the constraints.

While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests. Moreover, we prove that although undisclosed auditing offers informational advantages for the auditor, it paradoxically reduces the regulatory cost-effectiveness relative to disclosed auditing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5ba1\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8(MU)\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6267\u884c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MU\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u91c7\u7528\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u67e5\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9057\u5fd8\u4f7f\u5f97\u975e\u5408\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u53d1\u73b0\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u867d\u7136\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u53cd\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u516c\u5f00\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u6cd5\u5f8b\u89c4\u5b9a\u4e86\u2018\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u2019\uff0c\u4f46AI\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u5e38\u672a\u80fd\u9075\u5b88\u6570\u636e\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u3002\u800c\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\uff08MU\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u597d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u4e2a\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728MU\u7684\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u89c4\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7740\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u786e\u4fdd\u5408\u89c4\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u8bfb\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u754c\u5b9a\u51fa\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u63a5\u7740\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u4e0e\u8fd0\u8425\u65b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u9762\u5bf9MU\u7279\u6709\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6613\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u5143\u8f85\u52a9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u89e3\u8026\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u7684\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u3001\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u964d\u4f4e\u68c0\u67e5\u9891\u7387\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u8f83\u5f31\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u52a0\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u5bdf\u89c9\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u4e3a\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u76d1\u7ba1\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u89d2\u5ea6\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u5b83\u5374\u610f\u5916\u5730\u4e0d\u5982\u516c\u5f00\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5ba1\u6838\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u76d1\u7ba1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MU\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6cd5\u89c4\u6267\u884c\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u968f\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e5f\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9\u76d1\u7ba1\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

A \\emph{replicable online learning} algorithm is one that takes the same sequence of decisions across different executions in the same environment, with high probability. We initiate the study of algorithmic replicability in \\emph{constrained} MAB problems, where a learner interacts with an unknown stochastic environment for $T$ rounds, seeking not only to maximize reward but also to satisfy multiple constraints. Our main result is that replicability can be achieved in constrained MABs. Specifically, we design replicable algorithms whose regret and constraint violation match those of non-replicable ones in terms of $T$. As a key step toward these guarantees, we develop the first replicable UCB-like algorithm for \\emph{unconstrained} MABs, showing that algorithms that employ the optimism in-the-face-of-uncertainty principle can be replicable, a result that we believe is of independent interest.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u76ca\u6700\u5927\u5316\u53c8\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u591a\u79cd\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u539f\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236UCB\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6709\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\uff08MAB\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u505a\u51fa\u76f8\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53d7\u9650MAB\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u975e\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u5ea6\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fMAB\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236UCB\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u53d7\u9650MAB\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u6027\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\uff1b\u6240\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u5176\u8868\u73b0\uff08\u5c31\u9057\u61be\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u800c\u8a00\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e50\u89c2\u9762\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u539f\u5219\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236UCB\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5728\u6709\u989d\u5916\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u591f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u51fa\u65e2\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u53c8\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Standard discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL), based on fixed-step Bellman updates, struggles in this setting: as time gaps shrink, the $Q$-function collapses to the value function $V$, eliminating action ranking. Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm. Empirically, our method outperforms prior continuous-time and leading discrete-time baselines across challenging continuous-control benchmarks and a real-world trading task, achieving 21% profit over a single quarter$-$nearly doubling the second-best method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u66f4\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2dV\u51fd\u6570\u548cq\u4f18\u52bf\u7387\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9886\u5148\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u662f\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u4ee5\u975e\u5747\u5300\u3001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u3002\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u957f\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1a\u5f53\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0cQ\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u4ef7\u503c\u51fd\u6570V\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u597d\u574f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dq\u4eceV\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u800cV\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u5c0f\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u503c\u6d41\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5c06V\u548cq\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6982\u7387\u8bba\u70b9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8d85\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u8d1d\u5c14\u66fc\u5f0f\u6536\u7f29\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u4ea4\u6613\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u53ca\u9886\u5148\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5355\u5b63\u5ea621%\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u2014\u2014\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4actor-critic\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

To combat this lethal opioid crisis, graph learning methods have emerged as a promising paradigm for modeling complex drug-related phenomena. However, a significant gap remains: there is no comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating these methods across real-world opioid crisis scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce OPBench, the first comprehensive opioid benchmark comprising five datasets across three critical application domains: opioid overdose detection from healthcare claims, illicit drug trafficking detection from digital platforms, and drug misuse prediction from dietary patterns. Specifically, OPBench incorporates diverse graph structures, including heterogeneous graphs and hypergraphs, to preserve the rich and complex relational information among drug-related data. To address data scarcity, we collaborate with domain experts and authoritative institutions to curate and annotate datasets while adhering to privacy and ethical guidelines. Furthermore, we establish a unified evaluation framework with standardized protocols, predefined data splits, and reproducible baselines to facilitate fair and systematic comparison among graph learning methods. Through extensive experiments, we analyze the strengths and limitations of existing graph learning methods, thereby providing actionable insights for future research in combating the opioid crisis.

We introduce an explicit Information Bottleneck regularizer on the concept layer that penalizes $I(X;C)$ while preserving task-relevant information in $I(C;Y)$, encouraging minimal-sufficient concept representations. We derive two practical variants (a variational objective and an entropy-based surrogate) and integrate them into standard CBM training without architectural changes or additional supervision. Evaluated across six CBM families and three benchmarks, the IB-regularized models consistently outperform their vanilla counterparts. Information-plane analyses further corroborate the intended behavior. These results indicate that enforcing a minimal-sufficient concept bottleneck improves both predictive performance and the reliability of concept-level interventions. The proposed regularizer offers a theoretic-grounded, architecture-agnostic path to more faithful and intervenable CBMs, resolving prior evaluation inconsistencies by aligning training protocols and demonstrating robust gains across model families and datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u7684Information Bottleneck\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBMs\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cfI(X;C)\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606fI(C;Y)\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u989d\u5916\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff08CBMs\uff09\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u9762\u4e34\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee5\u53ca\u6982\u5ff5\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u6982\u5ff5\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u7684\u660e\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u60e9\u7f5aI(X;C)\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559I(C;Y)\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u8d44\u8baf\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8fd8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u5206\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6807\u51c6CBM\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u66f4\u6539\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u6dfb\u52a0\u66f4\u591a\u76d1\u7ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u516d\u4e2aCBM\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u540e\uff0cIB\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u7248\u672c\u3002\u4fe1\u606f\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u6240\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u5145\u5206\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e5f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5e72\u9884\u7684CBMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u534f\u8bae\u4e0d\u540c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, current optimizers are computationally expensive and do not scale to problems with hundreds or thousands of constraints. One notable exception is the Landing algorithm (Ablin et al., 2024) which, however comes at the expense of temporarily relaxing orthogonality. In this work, we revisit and improve on the ideas behind Landing, enabling the inclusion of modern adaptive optimizers while ensuring that orthogonal constraints are effectively met. Remarkably, these improvements come at little to no cost, and reduce the number of required hyperparemeters. Our algorithm POGO is fast and GPU-friendly, consisting of only 5 matrix products, and in practice maintains orthogonality at all times. On several challenging benchmarks, POGO greatly outperforms recent optimizers and shows it can optimize problems with thousands of orthogonal matrices in minutes while alternatives would take hours.

Beyond sample quality, an important yet less systematically studied question is whether trained generative models faithfully capture the diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we address this question by directly comparing the diversity of samples generated by state-of-the-art models with that of test samples drawn from the target data distribution, using recently proposed reference-free entropy-based diversity scores, Vendi and RKE. Across multiple benchmark datasets, we find that test data consistently attains substantially higher Vendi and RKE diversity scores than the generated samples, suggesting a systematic downward diversity bias in modern generative models. To understand the origin of this bias, we analyze the finite-sample behavior of entropy-based diversity scores and show that their expected values increase with sample size, implying that diversity estimated from finite training sets could inherently underestimate the diversity of the true distribution. As a result, optimizing the generators to minimize divergence to empirical data distributions would induce a loss of diversity. Finally, we discuss potential diversity-aware regularization and guidance strategies based on Vendi and RKE as principled directions for mitigating this bias, and provide empirical evidence suggesting their potential to improve the results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Vendi\u548cRKE\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u6307\u51fa\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u6e90\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eVendi\u548cRKE\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5e95\u5c42\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6307\u6807\uff08Vendi\u548cRKE\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6240\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u62bd\u53d6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u7684Vendi\u548cRKE\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5f97\u5206\u59cb\u7ec8\u660e\u663e\u9ad8\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5411\u4e0b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u6570\u671f\u671b\u503c\u968f\u6837\u672c\u5927\u5c0f\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u5927\uff0c\u6697\u793a\u7740\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f30\u7b97\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eVendi\u548cRKE\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u610f\u8bc6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

However, current SAE benchmarks on LLMs are often too noisy to differentiate architectural improvements, and current synthetic data experiments are too small-scale and unrealistic to provide meaningful comparisons. We introduce SynthSAEBench, a toolkit for generating large-scale synthetic data with realistic feature characteristics including correlation, hierarchy, and superposition, and a standardized benchmark model, SynthSAEBench-16k, enabling direct comparison of SAE architectures. Our benchmark reproduces several previously observed LLM SAE phenomena, including the disconnect between reconstruction and latent quality metrics, poor SAE probing results, and a precision-recall trade-off mediated by L0. We further use our benchmark to identify a new failure mode: Matching Pursuit SAEs exploit superposition noise to improve reconstruction without learning ground-truth features, suggesting that more expressive encoders can easily overfit. SynthSAEBench complements LLM benchmarks by providing ground-truth features and controlled ablations, enabling researchers to precisely diagnose SAE failure modes and validate architectural improvements before scaling to LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5de5\u5177SynthSAEBench\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u73b0\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578bSynthSAEBench-16k\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u5177\u518d\u73b0\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u89c4\u6a21\u592a\u5c0f\u4e14\u4e0d\u5207\u5b9e\u9645\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u540d\u4e3aSynthSAEBench\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u5305\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53e0\u52a0\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578bSynthSAEBench-16k\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528SynthSAEBench\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u590d\u73b0\u4e4b\u524d\u5728LLM SAE\u4e0a\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8131\u8282\u3001\u8f83\u5dee\u7684SAE\u63a2\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7531L0\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u5339\u914d\u8ffd\u8e2aSAE\u5229\u7528\u53e0\u52a0\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u6539\u5584\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "SynthSAEBench\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u53d7\u63a7\u6d88\u878d\u8865\u5145\u4e86LLM\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u81f3LLM\u4e4b\u524d\u7cbe\u786e\u8bca\u65adSAE\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Despite growing interest, the literature on targeted instruction selection remains fragmented and opaque: methods vary widely in selection budgets, often omit zero-shot baselines, and frequently entangle the contributions of key components. As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds. More broadly, our findings provide critical insights and a foundation for more principled data selection in LLM fine-tuning.

D2-LoRA achieves 76.4 percent average accuracy across eight question answering and reading comprehension benchmarks using only 5k training samples per task and two epochs, while preserving algebraic mergeability at inference with near-exact numerical equivalence. The method combines signed low-rank residual updates with additive and subtractive components, together with a train-time column-wise projection that keeps each column close to its original norm. After training, the adapter is merged into a single weight matrix, adding zero inference latency. Compared with LoRA, D2-LoRA improves average accuracy by 2.2 percentage points; at matched parameter counts (LoRA rank 2r versus D2-LoRA rank r), the improvement is 1.6 points, indicating gains from architectural design rather than increased parameterization. Compared with DoRA, it matches or exceeds performance on most tasks. Beyond QA and reading comprehension, D2-LoRA improves generative tasks (plus 1.2 ROUGE-L and plus 1.1 percent win rate) and shows 36 percent lower training volatility.

These layers are actually often obtained as the sum of two contributions: a residual path that copies the input and the output of a Transformer block. As a consequence, the inner representations (i.e. the input of these blocks) can be interpreted as iterative refinement of a propagated latent representation. Under this lens, many works suggest that the inner space is shared across layers, meaning that tokens can be decoded at early stages. Mechanistic interpretability even goes further by conjecturing that some layers act as refinement layers. Following this path, we propose inference-time inner looping, which prolongs refinement in pretrained off-the-shelf language models by repeatedly re-applying a selected block range. Across multiple benchmarks, inner looping yields modest but consistent accuracy improvements. Analyses of the resulting latent trajectories suggest more stable state evolution and continued semantic refinement. Overall, our results suggest that additional refinement can be obtained through simple test-time looping, extending computation in frozen pretrained models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u5757\u8303\u56f4\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5ef6\u957f\u7ec6\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u4f46\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f7f\u5f97\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u5316\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u5230\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aTransformer\u4e2d\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c42\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u7ec6\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5728\u5404\u5c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u662f\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u4ed6\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6765\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5faa\u73af\u8ba1\u7b97\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5b9e\u65bd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5373\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u91cd\u590d\u5e94\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5757\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6267\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u5b9e\u53ef\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Baumgartner"], "title": "Universal Algorithm-Implicit Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Current meta-learning methods are constrained to narrow task distributions with fixed feature and label spaces, limiting applicability. Moreover, the current meta-learning literature uses key terms like \"universal\" and \"general-purpose\" inconsistently and lacks precise definitions, hindering comparability. We introduce a theoretical framework for meta-learning which formally defines practical universality and introduces a distinction between algorithm-explicit and algorithm-implicit learning, providing a principled vocabulary for reasoning about universal meta-learning methods. Guided by this framework, we present TAIL, a transformer-based algorithm-implicit meta-learner that functions across tasks with varying domains, modalities, and label configurations. TAIL features three innovations over prior transformer-based meta-learners: random projections for cross-modal feature encoding, random injection label embeddings that extrapolate to larger label spaces, and efficient inline query processing. TAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard few-shot benchmarks while generalizing to unseen domains. Unlike other meta-learning methods, it also generalizes to unseen modalities, solving text classification tasks despite training exclusively on images, handles tasks with up to 20$\\times$ more classes than seen during training, and provides orders-of-magnitude computational savings over prior transformer-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86TAIL\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002TAIL\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u672a\u66fe\u9047\u5230\u8fc7\u7684\u66f4\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u5927\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u72ed\u7a84\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e'\u901a\u7528'\u548c'\u591a\u7528\u9014'\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0e\u7b97\u6cd5\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u533a\u522b\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86TAIL\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6ce8\u5165\u6807\u7b7e\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u66f4\u5927\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u5185\u8054\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u3002", "result": "TAIL\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4ec5\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6bd4\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u6240\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u6570\u591a\u8fbe20\u500d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u53ca\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u2014\u2014TAIL\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u53ef\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u51fa\u66f4\u52a0\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u80fd\u5728\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Stich"], "title": "On the Stability of Nonlinear Dynamics in GD and SGD: Beyond Quadratic Potentials", "comment": "Preprint", "summary": "The dynamical stability of the iterates during training plays a key role in determining the minima obtained by optimization algorithms. For example, stable solutions of gradient descent (GD) correspond to flat minima, which have been associated with favorable features. While prior work often relies on linearization to determine stability, it remains unclear whether linearized dynamics faithfully capture the full nonlinear behavior. Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable. This implies that stability can be dictated by a single batch that oscillates unstably, rather than an average effect, as linear analysis suggests. Finally, we prove that if all batches are linearly stable, the nonlinear dynamics of SGD are stable in expectation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u5bf9\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff08GD\uff09\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff08SGD\uff09\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u9644\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u7684\u5224\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5982\u679c\u6240\u6709\u6279\u6b21\u90fd\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5219SGD\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5fe0\u5b9e\u53cd\u6620\u5168\u90e8\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6b65\u957f\u8870\u51cf\u540e\u4ecd\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\uff08GD\uff09\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u9644\u8fd1\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faGD\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u7684\u786e\u5207\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u5c06\u5206\u6790\u6269\u5c55\u81f3SGD\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5373\u4f7f\u5355\u4e2a\u6279\u6b21\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u9884\u671f\u4e2d\u53d1\u6563\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u7531\u5355\u4e2a\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u632f\u8361\u7684\u6279\u6b21\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6240\u5efa\u8bae\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5982\u679c\u6240\u6709\u6279\u6b21\u90fd\u662f\u7ebf\u6027\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5219SGD\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u671f\u671b\u4e0a\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u9879\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4e0e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u4e8eGD\u548cSGD\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u52a0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

However, traditional MSBO assumes the input variables of the objective function to be independent and identically distributed, limiting its effectiveness in scenarios where causal information is available and interventions can be performed, such as clinical trials or policy-making. In the single-source domain, Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO) extends standard BO with the principles of causality, enabling better modeling of variable dependencies. This leads to more accurate optimization, improved decision-making, and more efficient use of low-cost information sources. In this article, we propose a principled integration of the MSBO and CBO methodologies in the multi-source domain, leveraging the strengths of both to enhance optimization efficiency and reduce computational complexity in higher-dimensional problems. We present the theoretical foundations of both Causal and Multi-Source Bayesian Optimization, and demonstrate how their synergy informs our Multi-Source Causal Bayesian Optimization (MSCBO) algorithm. We compare the performance of MSCBO against its foundational counterparts for both synthetic and real-world datasets with varying levels of noise, highlighting the robustness and applicability of MSCBO. Based on our findings, we conclude that integrating MSBO with the causality principles of CBO facilitates dimensionality reduction and lowers operational costs, ultimately improving convergence speed, performance, and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6e90\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MSCBO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6e90\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MSBO\uff09\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08CBO\uff09\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86MSCBO\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u5176\u57fa\u7840\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06MSBO\u4e0eCBO\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u539f\u5219\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6e90\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MSBO\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u53d8\u91cf\u662f\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5982\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6216\u653f\u7b56\u5236\u5b9a\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u5355\u6e90\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08CBO\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6e90\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6e90\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff08MSCBO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u591a\u6e90\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8be6\u7ec6\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u51faMSCBO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u53ca\u6765\u81ea\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MSCBO\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684MSBO\u548cCBO\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u539f\u5219\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ef4\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u3001\u64cd\u4f5c\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3001\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u529b\u53ca\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7REPL\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4ea4\u9519\u72b6\u6001\u63ed\u793a\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u5728\u8be5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u800cTransformers\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e2d\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u53ef\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5982Transformers\u548cRNNs\uff08\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5229\u7528REPL\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u663e\u793a\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u53d8\u6362\u3002\u5bf9\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u4ee5\u53caTransformers\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6709\u9650\u72b6\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u65b0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u800cTransformers\u5219\u672a\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u8003\u8651\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u662f\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u66f4\u80dc\u4e00\u7b79\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f6e\u6362\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u72b6\u6001\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\uff0c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027RNN\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4e8e\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, relying on sparse rewards makes this process highly sample-inefficient, as models must navigate vast search spaces with minimal feedback. While classic curriculum learning aims to mitigate this by ordering data based on complexity, the right ordering for a specific model is often unclear. To address this, we propose Goldilocks, a novel teacher-driven data sampling strategy that aims to predict each question's difficulty for the student model. The teacher model selects questions of appropriate difficulty for the student model, i.e., questions that are neither too easy nor too hard (Goldilocks principle), while training the student with GRPO. By leveraging the student's performance on seen samples, the teacher continuously adapts to the student's evolving abilities. On OpenMathReasoning dataset, Goldilocks data sampling improves the performance of models trained with standard GRPO under the same compute budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGoldilocks\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u9501\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4f1a\u8ba9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5fc5\u987b\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a2\u7d22\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6392\u5e8f\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Goldilocks\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7531\u6559\u5e08\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u3002\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u6765\u8bf4\u65e2\u4e0d\u592a\u96be\u4e5f\u4e0d\u592a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5408\u9002\u96be\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5373Goldilocks\u539f\u5219\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u3002\u6839\u636e\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u5df2\u89c1\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6559\u5e08\u4e0d\u65ad\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u751f\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728OpenMathReasoning\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6GRPO\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Goldilocks\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "Goldilocks\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u9762\u4e34\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6311\u6218\u65f6\u3002"}}

Yet it remains a mystery how rewards based solely on final outcomes can help overcome the long-horizon barrier to extended reasoning. To understand this, we develop a theory of the training dynamics of RL for transformers on compositional reasoning tasks. Our theory characterizes how the effectiveness of RLVR is governed by the smoothness of the difficulty spectrum. When data contains abrupt discontinuities in difficulty, learning undergoes grokking-type phase transitions, producing prolonged plateaus before progress recurs. In contrast, a smooth difficulty spectrum leads to a relay effect: persistent gradient signals on easier problems elevate the model's capabilities to the point where harder ones become tractable, resulting in steady and continuous improvement. Our theory explains how RLVR can improve performance at the edge of competence, and suggests that appropriately designed data mixtures can yield scalable gains. As a technical contribution, our analysis develops and adapts tools from Fourier analysis on finite groups to our setting. We validate the predicted mechanisms empirically via synthetic experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u514b\u670d\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8c31\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5bf9RLVR\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u7a81\u53d8\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u505c\u6ede\uff1b\u800c\u96be\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u8fc7\u6e21\u5219\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7a33\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5982\u4f55\u5e2e\u52a9\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u514b\u670d\u957f\u671f\u63a8\u7406\u969c\u788d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u4e8e\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e76\u8c03\u6574\u6709\u9650\u7fa4\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u96be\u5ea6\u8c31\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u662f\u5f71\u54cdRLVR\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f53\u96be\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u79cd\u63a5\u529b\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u6b65\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u5408\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u8c31\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u3002"}}

Yet, for a given task, a single \"best\" model rarely exists. In practice, each task is better served by multiple competing specialist models where different models excel on different data samples. As a result, for any given query, agents must reliably select the right specialist model from a heterogeneous pool of tool candidates. To this end, we introduce ToolSelect, which adaptively learns model selection for tools by minimizing a population risk over sampled specialist tool candidates using a consistent surrogate of the task-conditional selection loss. Concretely, we propose an Attentive Neural Process-based selector conditioned on the query and per-model behavioral summaries to choose among the specialist models. Motivated by the absence of any established testbed, we, for the first time, introduce an agentic Chest X-ray environment equipped with a diverse suite of task-specialized models (17 disease detection, 19 report generation, 6 visual grounding, and 13 VQA) and develop ToolSelectBench, a benchmark of 1448 queries. Our results demonstrate that ToolSelect consistently outperforms 10 SOTA methods across four different task families.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aToolSelect\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u5019\u9009\u8005\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u9009\u62e9\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u66ff\u4ee3\u7269\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u3002ToolSelect\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u603b\u7ed3\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u73af\u5883\uff08ToolSelectBench\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aToolSelect\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u5bb6\u65cf\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e10\u79cd\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f02\u8d28\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u6c60\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ToolSelect\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u5de5\u5177\u5019\u9009\u8005\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u9009\u62e9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6839\u636e\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u53ca\u5404\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6458\u8981\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u521b\u5efa\u4e86ToolSelectBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u914d\u5907\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5c04\u7ebf\u73af\u5883\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7cfb\u5217\uff08\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0eVQA\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cToolSelect\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5341\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "ToolSelect\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u60c5\u51b5\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We analyze the use of pseudo-calibration as a tool to counter this performance loss under a bounded label-conditional covariate shift model. Using tools from domain adaptation, we derive a lower bound on target coverage in terms of the source-domain loss of the classifier and a Wasserstein measure of the shift. Using this result, we provide a method to design pseudo-calibrated sets that inflate the conformal threshold by a slack parameter to keep target coverage above a prescribed level. Finally, we propose a source-tuned pseudo-calibration algorithm that interpolates between hard pseudo-labels and randomized labels as a function of classifier uncertainty. Numerical experiments show that our bounds qualitatively track pseudo-calibration behavior and that the source-tuned scheme mitigates coverage degradation under distribution shift while maintaining nontrivial prediction set sizes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6709\u754c\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u504f\u79fb\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6e90\u8c03\u4f18\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u786c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6e90\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff08CP\uff09\u5728\u4ea4\u6362\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u5206\u5e03\u8fb9\u7f18\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u82e5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u751f\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d1\u751f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u5de5\u5177\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8be5\u4e0b\u754c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6e90\u57df\u635f\u5931\u53ca\u504f\u79fb\u7684Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u677e\u5f1b\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5171\u5f62\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9884\u8bbe\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f9d\u636e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5728\u786c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6807\u7b7e\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u6e90\u8c03\u4f18\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u6e90\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6848\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u56e0\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fd8\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u7531\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6e90\u8c03\u4f18\u4f2a\u6821\u51c6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For strongly convex objectives, existing first-order methods achieve $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)-$unlearning, but they only use the forget set to calibrate injected noise, never as a direct optimization signal. In contrast, efficient empirical heuristics often exploit the forget samples (e.g., via gradient ascent) but come with no formal unlearning guarantees. We bridge this gap by presenting the Variance-Reduced Unlearning (VRU) algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, VRU is the first first-order algorithm that directly includes forget set gradients in its update rule, while provably satisfying ($(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)-$unlearning. We establish the convergence of VRU and show that incorporating the forget set yields strictly improved rates, i.e. a better dependence on the achieved error compared to existing first-order $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)-$unlearning methods. Moreover, we prove that, in a low-error regime, VRU asymptotically outperforms any first-order method that ignores the forget set.Experiments corroborate our theory, showing consistent gains over both state-of-the-art certified unlearning methods and over empirical baselines that explicitly leverage the forget set.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5VRU\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVRU\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u9636(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u660e\u786e\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u6765\u6821\u51c6\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4ece\u672a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u4e00\u4e9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u6837\u672c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8(VRU)\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "VRU\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e00\u9636\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u9996\u6b21\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u68af\u5ea6\u7eb3\u5165\u5176\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6ee1\u8db3(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u8fd8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86VRU\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u52a0\u5165\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u540e\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e25\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5373\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u9636(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0aVRU\u6e10\u8fd1\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u5ffd\u7565\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u5747\u663e\u793a\uff0cVRU\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u90a3\u4e9b\u660e\u786e\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VRU\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684(\u03b5,\u03b4)-\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

We work in an online setting where the data distribution can change arbitrarily over time. Existing approaches to this problem aim to minimize the set of objectives over the entire time horizon in a worst-case sense, and in practice they do not necessarily adapt to distribution shifts. Earlier work has aimed to alleviate this problem by incorporating additional objectives that target local guarantees over contiguous subintervals. Empirical evaluation of these proposals is, however, scarce. In this article, we consider an alternative procedure that achieves local adaptivity by replacing one part of the multi-objective learning method with an adaptive online algorithm.

Recently proposed Causal Foundation Models (CFMs) promise a more unified approach by amortising causal discovery and inference in a single step. However, in their current state, they do not allow for the incorporation of any domain knowledge, which can lead to suboptimal predictions. We bridge this gap by introducing methods to condition CFMs on causal information, such as the causal graph or more readily available ancestral information. When access to complete causal graph information is too strict a requirement, our approach also effectively leverages partial causal information. We systematically evaluate conditioning strategies and find that injecting learnable biases into the attention mechanism is the most effective method to utilise full and partial causal information. Our experiments show that this conditioning allows a general-purpose CFM to match the performance of specialised models trained on specific causal structures. Overall, our approach addresses a central hurdle on the path towards all-in-one causal foundation models: the capability to answer causal queries in a data-driven manner while effectively leveraging any amount of domain expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(CFMs)\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6216\u7956\u5148\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u901a\u7528CFM\u5339\u914d\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(CFMs)\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u6574\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u6216\u7956\u5148\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5230CFMs\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u7f6e\u662f\u5728\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u53ca\u90e8\u5206\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5141\u8bb8\u901a\u7528CFM\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e3a\u7279\u5b9a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8fc8\u5411\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u56e0\u679c\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u969c\u788d\uff1a\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u56de\u7b54\u56e0\u679c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u957f\u3002"}}

We introduce MacroGuide: Topological Guidance for Macrocycle Generation, a diffusion guidance mechanism that uses Persistent Homology to steer the sampling of pretrained molecular generative models toward the generation of macrocycles, in both unconditional and conditional (protein pocket) settings. At each denoising step, MacroGuide constructs a Vietoris-Rips complex from atomic positions and promotes ring formation by optimizing persistent homology features. Empirically, applying MacroGuide to pretrained diffusion models increases macrocycle generation rates from 1% to 99%, while matching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance on key quality metrics such as chemical validity, diversity, and PoseBusters checks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMacroGuide\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u53e3\u888b\uff09\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u53caPoseBusters\u68c0\u67e5\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u5bf9\u96be\u4ee5\u9776\u5411\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5177\u6709\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5206\u5b50\u836f\u7269\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u6b64\u7c7b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u7a00\u5c11\u53ca\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u62d3\u6251\u7ea6\u675f\u6240\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u5904\u4e8e\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "method": "MacroGuide: \u5229\u7528\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u671d\u5411\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u5411\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u4ece\u539f\u5b50\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6784\u5efaVietoris-Rips\u590d\u5f62\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528MacroGuide\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\uff0c\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7387\u4ece1%\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u4e8699%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548cPoseBusters\u68c0\u67e5\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "MacroGuide\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u514b\u670d\u5f53\u524d\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5b83\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5927\u73af\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u7b26\u5408\u91cd\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

While self-supervised multimodal contrastive learning has achieved remarkable progress, most existing methods predominantly capture redundant cross-modal signals, often neglecting modality-specific (unique) and interaction-driven (synergistic) information. Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components. To promote synergy modeling, we introduce asymmetric masking with complementary view-specific patterns, compelling the model to infer cross-modal dependencies rather than rely solely on redundant cues. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks and diverse MultiBench datasets demonstrate that COrAL consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art methods while exhibiting low performance variance across runs. These results indicate that explicitly modeling the full spectrum of multimodal information yields more stable, reliable, and comprehensive embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCOrAL\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u4e14\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u548c\u534f\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91c7\u7528\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u7f20\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u7279\u6027\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u906e\u7f69\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCOrAL\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u5dee\u4f4e\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5168\u8c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bd5\u56fe\u6269\u5c55\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u8981\u4e48\u672a\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u534f\u540c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4ee5\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u53ca\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "method": "COrAL\u5229\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u4ea4\u6027\u9650\u5236\u6765\u533a\u5206\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6709\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4fe1\u606f\u6210\u5206\u7684\u6e05\u6670\u5206\u79bb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5e26\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u89c6\u56fe\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u906e\u7f69\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u65ad\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5197\u4f59\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684MultiBench\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCOrAL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8868\u73b0\u4e00\u81f4\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6b21\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u5305\u62ec\u5197\u4f59\u3001\u72ec\u7279\u4ee5\u53ca\u534f\u540c\u5728\u5185\u7684\u5168\u90e8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u52a0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5411\u91cf\u3002"}}

Recently, defenders have developed classifier-based systems that have survived thousands of hours of human red teaming. We introduce Boundary Point Jailbreaking (BPJ), a new class of automated jailbreak attacks that evade the strongest industry-deployed safeguards. Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds. BPJ is difficult to defend against in individual interactions but incurs many flags during optimisation, suggesting that effective defence requires supplementing single-interaction methods with batch-level monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5BPJ\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ed1\u76d2\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6bcf\u6b21\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u662f\u5426\u6807\u8bb0\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\u4f4d\u3002BPJ\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u5bb3\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u80fd\u591f\u6700\u597d\u5730\u68c0\u6d4b\u653b\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5fae\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u70b9\uff08'\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9'\uff09\uff0c\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5bf9\u5baa\u6cd5\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u653b\u51fb\u79cd\u5b50\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u5bf9\u6297GPT-5\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u7ecf\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u5fa1\u6570\u5343\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4eec\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u5f0f\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9632\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aBPJ\u7684\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u767d\u76d2\u6216\u7070\u76d2\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u4fdd\u62a4\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "method": "BPJ\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u5bb3\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4e2d\u95f4\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u90a3\u4e9b\u6700\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\u653b\u51fb\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u2018\u8fb9\u754c\u70b9\u2019\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u662f\u5426\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd9\u4e00\u5355\u6bd4\u7279\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBPJ\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u653b\u51fb\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u901a\u7528\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297GPT-5\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cBPJ\u5728\u5355\u72ec\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u88ab\u9632\u5fa1\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u50cfBPJ\u8fd9\u6837\u521b\u65b0\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u62a4AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u514d\u53d7\u6076\u610f\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8be5\u8003\u8651\u5982\u4f55\u52a0\u5f3a\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4f46\u4e0d\u9650\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76d1\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Moreover, we investigate the performance of the model in the presence of sparse initial conditions. Our results make use of four Martian years (approx.~34 GB) of training data and a median compute budget of 13 GPU hours. We find that the combination of pretraining and model extension yields a performance increase of 34.4\\% on a held-out year.

In this paper, we study the sampling efficiency of score-based discrete diffusion models under a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) formulation, with a focus on $\u03c4$-leaping-based samplers. We establish sharp convergence guarantees for attaining $\\varepsilon$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for both uniform and masking noising processes. For uniform discrete diffusion, we show that the $\u03c4$-leaping algorithm achieves an iteration complexity of order $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$, with $d$ the ambient dimension of the target distribution, eliminating linear dependence on the vocabulary size $S$ and improving existing bounds by a factor of $d$; moreover, we establish a matching algorithmic lower bound showing that linear dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable in general. For masking discrete diffusion, we introduce a modified $\u03c4$-leaping sampler whose convergence rate is governed by an intrinsic information-theoretic quantity, termed the effective total correlation, which is bounded by $d \\log S$ but can be sublinear or even constant for structured data. As a consequence, the sampler provably adapts to low-dimensional structure without prior knowledge or algorithmic modification, yielding sublinear convergence rates for various practical examples (such as hidden Markov models, image data, and random graphs). Our analysis requires no boundedness or smoothness assumptions on the score estimator beyond control of the score entropy loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe(CTMC)\u516c\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e$\\tau$-leaping\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3002\u5728\u5747\u5300\u548c\u906e\u7f69\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230KL\u6563\u5ea6$\\varepsilon$\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u660e\u786e\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff0c$\\tau$-leaping\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a$\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f$S$\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u754c\u9650\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86$d$\u500d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ef4\u5ea6$d$\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u7684\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u906e\u7f69\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684$\\tau$-leaping\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u6536\u655b\u7387\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u79f0\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u8be5\u91cf\u88ab\u9650\u5236\u5728$d \\log S$\u5185\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u662f\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f7f\u5f97\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6216\u7b97\u6cd5\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff08CTMC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8$\\tau$-leaping\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\uff08CTMC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9$\\tau$-leaping\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5747\u5300\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u906e\u7f69\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u7279\u5b9aKL\u6563\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86$\\tau$-leaping\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a$\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon)$\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d$d$\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6781\u5927\u5730\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f$S$\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7ef4\u5ea6$d$\u4e0a\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u65e0\u6cd5\u907f\u514d\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u906e\u7f69\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684$\\tau$-leaping\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u7d27\u5bc6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6709\u6548\u603b\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u9002\u5e94\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9690\u85cf\u9a6c\u5c14\u79d1\u592b\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u56fe\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u52a0\u6df1\u4e86\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5206\u6570\u57fa\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an orbit representative with a canonical pose or order, train an unconstrained (non-equivariant) diffusion or flow model on the canonical slice, and finally recover the invariant distribution by sampling a random symmetry transform at generation time. Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries. By leveraging geometric spectra-based canonicalization and mild positional encodings, canonical diffusion significantly outperforms equivariant baselines in 3D molecule generation tasks, with similar or even less computation.

We introduce a large-scale benchmark, PAPerBench, to systematically study how increasing context length influences both personalization quality and privacy protection in LLMs. The benchmark comprises approximately 29,000 instances with context lengths ranging from 1K to 256K tokens, yielding a total of 377K evaluation questions. It jointly evaluates personalization performance and privacy risks across diverse scenarios, enabling controlled analysis of long-context model behavior. Extensive evaluations across state-of-the-art LLMs reveal consistent performance degradation in both personalization and privacy as context length increases. We further provide a theoretical analysis of attention dilution under context scaling, explaining this behavior as an inherent limitation of soft attention in fixed-capacity Transformers. The empirical and theoretical findings together suggest a general scaling gap in current models -- long context, less focus. We release the benchmark to support reproducible evaluation and future research on scalable privacy and personalization.
