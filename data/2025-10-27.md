Abstract: Users increasingly interact with content across multiple domains, resulting
in sequential behaviors marked by frequent and complex transitions. While
Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) models two-domain interactions,
Multi-Domain Sequential Recommendation (MDSR) introduces significantly more
domain transitions, compounded by challenges such as domain heterogeneity and
imbalance. Existing approaches often overlook the intricacies of domain
transitions, tend to overfit to dense domains while underfitting sparse ones,
and struggle to scale effectively as the number of domains increases. We
propose \textit{GMFlowRec}, an efficient generative framework for MDSR that
models domain-aware transition trajectories via Gaussian Mixture Flow Matching.
GMFlowRec integrates: (1) a unified dual-masked Transformer to disentangle
domain-invariant and domain-specific intents, (2) a Gaussian Mixture flow field
to capture diverse behavioral patterns, and (3) a domain-aligned prior to
support frequent and sparse transitions. Extensive experiments on JD and Amazon
datasets demonstrate that GMFlowRec achieves state-of-the-art performance with
up to 44\% improvement in NDCG@5, while maintaining high efficiency via a
single unified backbone, making it scalable for real-world multi-domain
sequential recommendation.

Abstract: This paper discusses the issue regarding Non-verbal Autism Spectrum Disorder.
It has been observed that this mental disorder is listed in major parts of the
world including the US, UK, and India. To mitigate this type of disorder, a
wide range of smartphones, computers, and artificial intelligence technologies
have been used. This technology has helped the population cope with
socialization and communication needs. Many applications have been developed to
enhance the communication capabilities of non-verbal autistic children. This
thesis project proposes the development of a platform that includes a web panel
and an Android mobile application to assist non-verbal autistic children in
communication, especially in Oman. Different interventions have been merged to
improve the quality of life for people on the autism spectrum. The main problem
identified in this case is that fragmented approaches are not suitable for
autistic children. The augmented reality framework provides the capability to
engage autistic children in creative play and self-reflection through
interactive screen-based activities.

Abstract: Multimodal conversational recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm
for delivering personalized experiences through natural dialogue enriched by
visual and contextual grounding. Yet, current multimodal conversational
recommendation datasets remain limited: existing resources either simulate
conversations, omit user history, or fail to collect sufficiently detailed
feedback, all of which constrain the types of research and evaluation they
support.
  To address these gaps, we introduce VOGUE, a novel dataset of 60 humanhuman
dialogues in realistic fashion shopping scenarios. Each dialogue is paired with
a shared visual catalogue, item metadata, user fashion profiles and histories,
and post-conversation ratings from both Seekers and Assistants. This design
enables rigorous evaluation of conversational inference, including not only
alignment between predicted and ground-truth preferences, but also calibration
against full rating distributions and comparison with explicit and implicit
user satisfaction signals.
  Our initial analyses of VOGUE reveal distinctive dynamics of visually
grounded dialogue. For example, recommenders frequently suggest items
simultaneously in feature-based groups, which creates distinct conversational
phases bridged by Seeker critiques and refinements. Benchmarking multimodal
large language models against human recommenders shows that while MLLMs
approach human-level alignment in aggregate, they exhibit systematic
distribution errors in reproducing human ratings and struggle to generalize
preference inference beyond explicitly discussed items. These findings
establish VOGUE as both a unique resource for studying multimodal
conversational systems and as a challenge dataset beyond the current
recommendation capabilities of existing top-tier multimodal foundation models
such as GPT-4o-mini, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generative recommendation is emerging as a transformative paradigm by
directly generating recommended items, rather than relying on matching.
Building such a system typically involves two key components: (1) optimizing
the tokenizer to derive suitable item identifiers, and (2) training the
recommender based on those identifiers. Existing approaches often treat these
components separately--either sequentially or in alternation--overlooking their
interdependence. This separation can lead to misalignment: the tokenizer is
trained without direct guidance from the recommendation objective, potentially
yielding suboptimal identifiers that degrade recommendation performance.
  To address this, we propose BLOGER, a Bi-Level Optimization for GEnerative
Recommendation framework, which explicitly models the interdependence between
the tokenizer and the recommender in a unified optimization process. The lower
level trains the recommender using tokenized sequences, while the upper level
optimizes the tokenizer based on both the tokenization loss and recommendation
loss. We adopt a meta-learning approach to solve this bi-level optimization
efficiently, and introduce gradient surgery to mitigate gradient conflicts in
the upper-level updates, thereby ensuring that item identifiers are both
informative and recommendation-aligned. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that BLOGER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
generative recommendation methods while maintaining practical efficiency with
no significant additional computational overhead, effectively bridging the gap
between item tokenization and autoregressive generation.

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at
https://github.com/YoungZ365/Pctx.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.

Abstract: The use of natural language (NL) user profiles in recommender systems offers
greater transparency and user control compared to traditional representations.
However, there is scarcity of large-scale, publicly available test collections
for evaluating NL profile-based recommendation. To address this gap, we
introduce SciNUP, a novel synthetic dataset for scholarly recommendation that
leverages authors' publication histories to generate NL profiles and
corresponding ground truth items. We use this dataset to conduct a comparison
of baseline methods, ranging from sparse and dense retrieval approaches to
state-of-the-art LLM-based rerankers. Our results show that while baseline
methods achieve comparable performance, they often retrieve different items,
indicating complementary behaviors. At the same time, considerable headroom for
improvement remains, highlighting the need for effective NL-based
recommendation approaches. The SciNUP dataset thus serves as a valuable
resource for fostering future research and development in this area.

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,
and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and
adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

Abstract: Multilingual e-commerce search suffers from severe data imbalance across
languages, label noise, and limited supervision for low-resource
languages--challenges that impede the cross-lingual generalization of relevance
models despite the strong capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this
work, we present a practical, architecture-agnostic, data-centric framework to
enhance performance on two core tasks: Query-Category (QC) relevance (matching
queries to product categories) and Query-Item (QI) relevance (matching queries
to product titles). Rather than altering the model, we redesign the training
data through three complementary strategies: (1) translation-based augmentation
to synthesize examples for languages absent in training, (2) semantic negative
sampling to generate hard negatives and mitigate class imbalance, and (3)
self-validation filtering to detect and remove likely mislabeled instances.
Evaluated on the CIKM AnalytiCup 2025 dataset, our approach consistently yields
substantial F1 score improvements over strong LLM baselines, achieving
competitive results in the official competition. Our findings demonstrate that
systematic data engineering can be as impactful as--and often more deployable
than--complex model modifications, offering actionable guidance for building
robust multilingual search systems in the real-world e-commerce settings.
